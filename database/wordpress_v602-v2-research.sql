A Month later, PayPal has written to use to say that our account has been restricted and have requested us to take out PayPal as a payment method from our vape shop web directory. We do not offer CBD products like CBD oil. We solely provide marketing and advertising services to CBD companies. I have visited Holland &amp; Barrett-- the UK\\\'s Reputable Health and wellness Retail store and if you take a good look, you will witness that they promote a fairly substantial series of CBD items, primarily CBD oil and they also happen to take PayPal as a settlement method. It appears that PayPal is administering twos sets of rules to many different firms. As a result of this restriction, I can no longer accept PayPal on my CBD-related site. This has limited my payment possibilities and presently, I am heavily dependent on Cryptocurrency payments and straightforward bank transfers. I have gotten in touch with a solicitor from a Magic Circle law firm in The city of london and they said that what PayPal is doing is altogether not legal and discriminatory as it ought to be applying a consistent benchmark to all firms. I am yet to speak to yet another attorney from a US law practice in London to see what PayPal\\\'s legal position is in the USA. Meanwhile, I would be highly appreciative if anyone here at targetdomain could offer me with substitute payment processors/merchants that work with CBD companies.',0,'post-trashed','','comment',0,0),(6,2167,'Felisa','support@modapharma.com','https://images.google.com.tw/url?q=https://www.skinaestheticlinic.com/3-tricks-to-clean-your-e-mail-record-and-hold-engagement-high/','147.78.141.85','2021-12-12 19:15:35','2021-12-12 19:15:35','can i vape hash',0,'post-trashed','','comment',0,0),(7,2167,'project runway guy who makes ugly pink lingerie','merakiwelivelikethis@gmail.com','https://lkazka.com.ua/user/thumbchef2624/','147.78.141.85','2022-01-17 08:14:30','2022-01-17 08:14:30','Can someone recommend Sexy &amp; Seductive Styles?

Before the official release date, time is set aside for the community to perform final reviews and help test. Since the WordPress ecosystem includes thousands of plugins and themes, it is important that everyone checks to see if anything was missed along the way. That means the project would <em>love</em> your help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.1 is planned for official release on November 1st, 2022, three weeks from today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This version of the WordPress software is under development</strong>. Please do not install, run, or test this version of WordPress on production or mission-critical websites. Instead, it is recommended that you test RC1 on a test server and site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test WordPress 6.1 RC1 in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 1: </strong>Install and activate

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I have with us today on the WordPress Briefing a couple of special guests. I have <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ironprogrammer/\">Brian Alexander</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/annezazu/\">Anne McCarthy</a>. I&#8217;m gonna ask you both to tell us a little bit about yourselves, if you can tell us what you do with the WordPress project, maybe how long you&#8217;ve been with WordPress, and if there are any particular teams that you contribute to, that would be great.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian, why don&#8217;t you get us started?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:01:02]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Brian. I work on the WordPress project as a full-time contributor, sponsored by Automattic. And I am one of the Test Team reps, so I help promote testing across the project. And that&#8217;s not just in Core, but it could be for Themes, Performance, feature plugins, what have you. So try to make that stuff move forward and wrangle as many people as we can to get on board and help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:32]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent. All right, and Anne, what about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:01:36]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spearhead the Full Site Editing outreach program. I am a sponsor contributor for Automattic as well, and so I contribute across a couple of different teams depending upon what the outreach program needs as well as various release squads I have been a part of. So for 6.1 coming up, I&#8217;m one of the co-Core Editor triage leads.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian is also on the squad as the co-Test lead, which is very exciting. So it&#8217;s been fun to work with him and be on the podcast. And I&#8217;ve been around the WordPress project since about 2011. But this is, the last couple of years, the first time I&#8217;ve been able to be sponsored by Automattic and be a part of giving back to the community that&#8217;s given me so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:13]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazing. All right. For folks who&#8217;ve been listening to the WP Briefing for a while, you know that I&#8217;ve been saying for like a full year that I think that testing is one of the best onboarding opportunities we have. And then also I really like to bring in our co-creators of WordPress through that testing program. Because we don&#8217;t know whether we&#8217;re right or not unless people tell us that we&#8217;re right or not. And we would like to hear so much from the users who, you know, use it and don&#8217;t necessarily have an opportunity, that privilege to kind of build on it or build the CMS itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I just have a few questions since I&#8217;ve got a couple of our strong testing wranglers here. The first thing I have is what are you doing? Or, do you have any advice for getting people outside of our active contributor base and the community to participate in testing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:03:03]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can kick this off. Just thinking about the Full Site Editing outreach program model. So just for context, there are various calls for testing in different formats. So everything from really procedural where you&#8217;re following exact steps to follow, to very open-ended calls for testing, as well as we recently did usability testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of the things that come to mind immediately just for getting different contributors is to have very specific, fun, engaging, relevant tests that can draw people in. So if you have a call for testing that really speaks to someone, they might be more willing to participate. As well as just different formats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So someone may not want to, you know, follow 30 steps, but they might want to follow something more open-ended. They might want to answer a survey rather than opening a GitHub link. And so I think a lot of facilitation with the outreach program has served us really well to bring in different folks as well as explicitly reaching out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve done a number of talks in different WordPress related spaces and non-WordPress spaces to try to tell people about what we&#8217;re up to and really go meet them where they are. Because I think that&#8217;s ultimately, especially with Covid and the pandemic, there was a really unique opportunity to do that and to join the random online meetup that was happening and talk about the program and talk about ways that people could get involved and feel heard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:04:12]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the last thing I&#8217;ll mention is translations. The program that&#8217;s culture testing that I write is written in English, but I&#8217;m very fortunate to have people who translate those. And so that&#8217;s a huge way that I cannot contribute but that other people have. And so I really want to highlight that and call that out because it&#8217;s been hugely impactful to have these calls for testing in a way that people can more readily access.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:32]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:04:35]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I was going to add in, in addition to the calls for testing that are, as Anne said, structured such to isolate so that someone can just kind of go through a list of steps to do rather than just being exposed to Trac or GitHub and have kind of snow blindness with, with everything that&#8217;s happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a Week in Test series of posts that goes out about every week. And what we try to do with that series is to curate a list of posts that might be a good starting point. So we try to find one that, in each type of testing example, is something that would, a more novice contributor might be able to start with. Things for more intermediate and then also advanced ones that, for testers who may need to have a development environment and the ability to make some pretty deep or type of customizations to their WordPress project in order to test a patch or reproduce a particular issue that might be happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s a good springboard for someone to come in where there&#8217;s just a small thing that they can kind of look at and then dive into the larger process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:46]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely. That&#8217;s very smart. It&#8217;s hard to figure out how to get started in WordPress at all, let alone as a contributing by testing things sort of area. That feels new to WordPress even though the team has been around for a long time. And so I think that&#8217;s excellent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian, you mentioned in your note about who you are and what you&#8217;re doing that you&#8217;re helping with testing not only in the test section in the Test Team but then also across the project. So, I have a follow-up question for you. What can developers do to create better tests for their software?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:06:18]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are sections within the Core handbook that kind of go into detail about the types of tests that should accompany individual contributions. A lot of those require kind of an extra step, and some developers maybe don&#8217;t have as much experience there. So hopefully, the Core handbook can provide a little bit of that guidance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a lot of contributors who are interested in things such as unit testing, E2E testing, which is end-to-end testing, and testing in JavaScript or in PHP. So there&#8217;s a wide variety of the types of tests that you can actually contribute to. And I would say maybe about 50% of the tickets that I&#8217;ve triaged, personally, the contributor who brought in the patch was unable to or was not familiar with providing unit tests. So that is a very good opportunity for someone to come in who maybe is not as well versed in the depth of what the patch was involved with. But by contributing a user test, they get an opportunity to look very focused at a particular piece of code, what was modified, and then create unit tests based on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:07:40]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then once that unit test has been submitted and starting to be reviewed, other reviewers, Core contributors, or Core committers, I would say, they&#8217;ll start looking at that and if there are additional details that should be there, expanding the tests or little modifications. Then that also is feedback to that test contributor so that the next time they come in, they&#8217;re more prepared for it. They&#8217;re learning more about Core, and eventually, maybe they&#8217;ll also become a Core contributor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:07]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent. We will include links to these handbook pages and documentation in the show notes if you&#8217;re listening to the podcast on your favorite podcasting platform, Pocketcasts, or it&#8217;s somewhere else. I don&#8217;t know where people listen to podcasts, but if you&#8217;re listening to it somewhere that&#8217;s not on the website, you can come to get that on wordpress.org/news.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, the next question that I have, and I think this is for both of you, Brian, it sounds like you partially answered it, but I bet there are more answers from Anne as well. What advice do you have for those submitting bug reports?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:08:38]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll chime in to start, and then Brian, I&#8217;d love to hear your unique take because I also think you do an excellent job whenever I&#8217;ve engaged with you in various places of providing really good replication steps. And so I love that, and I wanna offer things specific to WordPress itself and something that I&#8217;ve noticed that&#8217;s more cultural rather than necessarily like steps to follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of the things I&#8217;ve noticed that I think has started to come up partially with Covid is people, you know, you start talking at WordCamps or at a meetup, and a bug comes up, and you find someone who knows where to put it, and that kind of connection is has been frayed in the last couple years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so one of the things I feel like I&#8217;ve been saying to a lot of different people at this unique point in time is that it doesn&#8217;t need to be perfect. Don&#8217;t let perfect be the enemy of good. And so if it means you just need to drop it in a Slack channel and you just are like, I don&#8217;t know where to put this, that&#8217;s huge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to hear from people across the project. And I just really encourage anyone, even if you don&#8217;t have the complete information or you&#8217;re not a hundred percent sure you&#8217;re afraid it&#8217;s been reported 10 times before, like, please still report it because we need those reports and also if 10 people reported it and it&#8217;s still not fixed, that also means we need to iterate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:09:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that&#8217;s one of the things, especially with the Full Site Editing outreach program, I feel people will message me saying, hey, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard this a bunch, but… And sometimes I&#8217;ve never heard it at all. And I shudder to think of all the people who have not reached out or have not posted in GitHub or Trac or wherever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, share, and write blog posts. I think that another great way that people can give feedback is if you don&#8217;t know how to get into the depths of WordPress, writing a post and talking about it and sharing it on social media is also a great way to get attention. I read a lot of those. But as much as possible, getting to, if you can, if you&#8217;re comfortable, getting to the source where we&#8217;re able to see it in Github or Trac goes a really long way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And share as much as you can. And don&#8217;t worry if you can&#8217;t spend hours writing the perfect bug report, we still wanna hear from you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:10:21]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Building off of what Anne said, just the fact that you&#8217;re speaking out and raising an issue is a huge step for many, many people. And once, once you&#8217;ve actually done that, as Anne said, it doesn&#8217;t need to be perfect. There are a lot of other people who are going to be looking at these bugs, trying to figure out the replication steps used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So even if you can&#8217;t provide all this detail up front, someone will help. On the back end, they&#8217;ll help kind of fill in those gaps. If you do have the time to actually get deep into providing a very detailed bug report, then there are some key aspects of the bug report that make it very helpful for contributors, not only testers, who should be able to reproduce the issue to validate and make sure that this isn&#8217;t something that&#8217;s unique, unique to a plugin, to a custom theme or snippet that you dropped into your functions PHP.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, also for the actual Core contributors, who then need to be able to understand what is happening so that they can fix the right thing. And some of those items are the information about your testing environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:11:34]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that could be your browser, your server, the type, whether it&#8217;s Apache, Nginx, et cetera, the operating system you&#8217;re running, what version of PHP you&#8217;re running, the version of WordPress, very critical, and…&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:49]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Super important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:11:51]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any themes and plugins that you&#8217;re using. And that kind of information helps set the stage, and then other people will be able to set up their environment similarly if they&#8217;re going to try to test it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After you have provided the environmental information, the steps required to reproduce the issue should be as detailed as possible. You may not have realized that clicking this caused such and such to happen, so just try to remember, or maybe even walk through if it&#8217;s something you can repeat multiple times, walk through a couple of times and write down everything that you&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:12:30]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that you&#8217;re sure, hey, this is the way that I can reproduce this bug. And then those steps will be very helpful for other contributors when they&#8217;re reviewing it. And then it&#8217;s also very helpful if you have video, screenshots, debug logs, any of those other kinds of resources that you could refer to because not all bugs are easy to explain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we tend to… Trac and GitHub issues for the Gutenberg project, everybody&#8217;s writing in English. And maybe your main language is not English, and it might be a little bit challenging to do that. So providing a video, it&#8217;s worth a thousand words in any language. So, if you can provide those types of assets, that&#8217;s also very important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:22]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and I&#8217;ll share a little bit of a you&#8217;re-not-alone-in-it sort of anecdotes from the first few bugs that I ever filed for WordPress. I sort of had this feeling that if I were to file a bug, everyone would know that I wasn&#8217;t a developer. And like everyone knows, I&#8217;m not a developer, but a little bit I was like, they&#8217;ll know now. And so if that&#8217;s where you are also,&nbsp; Anne said it, and Brian said it as well, like, we can&#8217;t fix things that we don&#8217;t realize are broken. And just because you&#8217;ve run into it 15 times, which obviously should never happen, you should run into it once, and then we know, but it happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you run into it 15 times, probably other people have as well. And if it&#8217;s still not fixed, it might be because no one has thought to themselves I should tell someone that&#8217;s broken. And so if that&#8217;s your primary hurdle, folks out there in our listening space, I was once there too. And honestly, knowing that it&#8217;s a problem is as valuable as knowing the solution to it most of the time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:14:23]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and those are, I wanted to add, there is a lot to that to remember. That&#8217;s a lot to remember in terms of what you should be submitting, what, or I should say, what would be ideal in what you&#8217;re submitting. But luckily, in the test handbook, there&#8217;s a test report section, and it includes a description, it goes everything from, it starts with why we do bug reports to examples of the types of testing, whether it be for bugs or enhancements, which also need testing, and it has templates in there that you can copy and paste directly into Trac. And that&#8217;s very helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah,, we will have links to those in the show notes as well. Since we&#8217;re right there at that moment, what do you think we could do as WordPress to make reporting problems easier?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:15:15]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that this has been something that&#8217;s come up during our weekly meetings, discussions on the Core test channel, as well as in contributor day test table discussions. And the test documentation that&#8217;s on the website is a little bit fragmented. I believe that the current test handbook was originally written for a type of flow analysis and feedback testing that is not the norm today. So it&#8217;s a little bit confusing. The terminology is a little dated, and the most recent updates that have been provided on there relate solely to Gutenberg, which is very important that that also be represented, but, in order to find information about testing and Trac or PHP unit tests, you have to go over to the core handbook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we could definitely make things improved by consolidating, bringing everything into one area so that if you are interested in testing, you&#8217;ll have everything in one place and not be split between that and not have outdated methodologies that are asking you to submit videos that nobody&#8217;s going to really look at because we&#8217;re not doing the flow tests anymore. So I think that that would be a benefit to future testers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:16:41]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne, any thoughts?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:16:43]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I&#8217;ll also add that I think there are like two things we can do. One is, there&#8217;s so much happening in the WordPress project in such a cool way that I think the more we can write targeted tests and talk to people about, like, hey, here&#8217;s this new thing coming. This is a high-impact area to test. It&#8217;s under active iteration. You&#8217;re gonna get a lot of engagement. People are really thinking about this and pulling people into that where you kind of get the momentum of getting the feedback in right when someone needs it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we could do that a bit more to make reporting problems easier because it&#8217;s kind of like you&#8217;re in the thick of it with a lot of people rather than maybe exploring an area where someone hasn&#8217;t looked at it in a minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that’s the thing that comes to mind is just the more we can take the time. I think this release cycle has been really good with that, where there&#8217;s been a call for testing for fluid typography. There&#8217;s also been one for using block template parts and classic themes. And there&#8217;s a ton of stuff that&#8217;s been happening where we can kind of make these both developer and more end user testing experiences easier and better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Brian has done a great job continuing the tradition of, you know, helping test this latest release cycle. And he&#8217;s taken those posts and done an amazing job of helping, having specific testing as well. Tied to this, I think just this has always been a thing but better, easier testing environments for developers and for quickly setting up more WordPress sites to test things for end users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:17:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Another thing that we have been discussing in Slack in the Core and Core Test channels is the possibility of pre-populating the Trac tickets. With a template based on what it is that you&#8217;re reporting. So similar to copying a template for a test report out of the handbook. Instead, you would hit a button to say the type of bug you are submitting, and then it would pre-populate that, and then you could fill in the gaps for that. This already happens over in Gutenberg. There, there are templates, and I find that that is very helpful. And so being able to do that in Trac would be useful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then for reporting problems on the user side, I thought that it would be interesting to have like you have for any other modern app, a button that says Report Bug in WordPress that could capture some intelligence data for your installation, the page that you&#8217;re on and have a simple text box where you could provide a little description and then submit that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:19:08]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, these wouldn&#8217;t be the types of things that would just go straight into Trac, most likely. However, it would be an opportunity to allow end users to just send something in, and start having it looked at, rather than looking and saying, okay, I found a bug in WordPress. Now, what do I do?&nbsp; And then not reporting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that would be the worst case is that the bug just doesn&#8217;t get reported. So that would be information that is already harvested if you go to your site health screen and your WordPress installation. A lot of that information that would be useful is there. In this type of bug report, we would want to anonymize and strip a lot of that information out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of private stuff you don&#8217;t wanna share, but there is that data there that&#8217;s available that could potentially help in doing a bug report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:19:57]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brilliant. All right. Question for everyone in the room: what opportunities are there currently to help with testing? Anne, I know, and you already mentioned a few, we can just bombard everybody with links to the tests if we want. But yeah, what opportunities are currently out there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:20:13]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;ll mention the Full Site Editing outreach program. I&#8217;m very biased, but we&#8217;re always looking for new folks. We just crossed, I think, 600 people, which was unbelievable. So even if you&#8217;re not necessarily always able to help join the calls for testing, you can always pop into the FSE outreach experiment channel, which we&#8217;ll also add a link to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s just a great way when you have time to join because I flag stuff all the time, whether it&#8217;s about the outreach program or just in general across the project. Brian does really good weekly round-up testing posts as well. So make.wordpress.org/test is also a great place to get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then right now, I think when this comes out, will be a great time to be helping test WordPress 6.1. So check out that post. I kind of wanna just shove everyone in that direction currently cause I think that&#8217;s the most high-impact thing to get involved with and one of the great ways to give back to the next version of WordPress to make it really delightful and easy to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m just gonna leave it there, even though there are so many ways you can help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:21:11]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.1 coming out on November 1st if you haven&#8217;t yet heard about it. Brian, what else have you got out there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:21:16]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the online stuff, Anne covered that pretty well. I would say if you have a local WordCamp, sign up for their contributor day or if there are any local WordPress meetups. When Covid ended up hitting and lockdowns were rolled out, a lot of this stuff started to really slow down. So I think now is a good time to maybe introduce the idea for, hey, let&#8217;s have a local meetup, and for a couple of hours, we&#8217;ll just do some testing, and look at some stuff in WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it might be a good way of getting people re-engaged. It&#8217;s a little bit lighter weight if you&#8217;re doing testing versus trying to actually provide a patch to fix an issue. So, might be a good way of bringing in some new faces and re-engaging people who we lost over the lockdown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:22:09]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and if you all have never done a testing party for WordPress before, and it sounds like it&#8217;s maybe a really boring thing, it&#8217;s actually not, she said with strong authority and opinions. But also, I have never had a more successful learning experience with the WordPress CMS than when I was trying to figure it out with other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They see things that you don&#8217;t see, they know things you don&#8217;t know, and it really covers a lot of the bases for unknown unknowns when you&#8217;re trying to learn something. And then also you have all these people that like, we’re really in it with you, and everyone&#8217;s really pulling for each other, and it&#8217;s actually a bit more fun than it sounds like when you&#8217;re just like, a testing party. It turns into just like jointly solving a puzzle together, which I think sounds like a lot of fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like a party, but for technology, I would feel this way. I am a mad extrovert, and we all know it, but. Now you two know it as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:23:08]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a final, just like a fun question for you both, and if you have an answer, great. And if you don&#8217;t have an answer, I would be surprised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here we go. Last question of the day. If five more volunteers suddenly appeared to help on the Test Team, what would they do? Just, I waved a magic wand. I guess that&#8217;s what made it fun. I don&#8217;t know why. I was like, fun question and then I&#8217;m, like, assigned tasks that, Yeah, I waved a magic wand. That&#8217;s what made it fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:23:38]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I would say I would probably point them to FSE outreach program posts because…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:23:45]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Woot woot.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:23:47]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>…the outreach program does a great job of outlining steps. You&#8217;re isolating testing in one particular area. It&#8217;s got a lot of tests. There&#8217;s examples of the types of feedback that you&#8217;re looking for, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a really good introduction to it, and most FSE testing does not require a local dev environment. Which is probably the biggest hurdle for a new tester coming in. If you do have developers with more experience, then they could start–and they wanted to look into Trac tickets or GitHub issues– then it does take a little bit of setup and you may spend the next few hours configuring your development environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So instead, I would recommend that you start with something like FSE outreach program posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:24:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did not pay Brian to say that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:24:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re just all partial to it here. That&#8217;s all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:24:45]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, we really are. Yeah, no, this is, I love this question, and I actually find it really fun cause I think about it a lot. And we&#8217;ve talked about some of this stuff too, and it&#8217;s something that when I think about five more people suddenly appearing, makes me giddy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we have folks, who have helped with like, I think I&#8217;ve mentioned like translations and group testing and even responding to questions that come from the channel and like, I just wish if we had five folks full time dedicated to that, I could see way more hallway hangouts where we casually talk about stuff and actually go on a call and talk live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could see folks, someone dedicated to helping translations and translating even more places. We have an Italian contributor who does it regularly, and a couple of Japanese contributors every once in awhile we get Spanish translation. But I&#8217;d love to see more translations to bring more people in, more facilitating group testing, more types of testing, helping me be more creative because sometimes I get a creative wall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But more than anything, if I really think long term about the project and thinking about this outreach program model, which I don&#8217;t think I fully appreciated how new it was, Josepha, when you introduced the idea, I think it would be so neat to bring in more folks to actually create new outreach programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:25:52]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So maybe there&#8217;s an outreach program for theme authors or block theme authors, or maybe there&#8217;s an outreach program around collaborative editing. Like what does this look like, and how can we expand this to bring more people in? And I think a lot of that will prove the resiliency and lessons we&#8217;ve learned from Covid in the WordPress community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can&#8217;t necessarily always rely on the meetup groups, so how can we meet people where they are? And I think there&#8217;s something really interesting and almost serendipitous that the outreach program started literally, I think it was like May 2020, like a couple of months into the pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I, like, I want to see it in a position of strength where we both have the in-person community alongside this outreach program model that can intertwine work. And I&#8217;d love to see the model expand to different types. And right now, maybe part of that is we use the outreach program model, the full site editing outreach program group itself, to experiment more and to keep that level of experimentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s something I feel really strongly about is continuing to find what works and what doesn&#8217;t. And so if we had five more people, I could just, I&#8217;d probably go wild and have all sorts of cool, cool things and spinoffs, but I&#8217;m more introverted than Josepha, so there&#8217;s limitations to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:26:56]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, you heard it here first. If you&#8217;re one of my 6,000 listeners. I only need five of one of you. Five of the ones of you to come and make Anne&#8217;s whole life an exciting joy for the next 12 months. So, I only need five of you and I know that you&#8217;re out there. There are 2000 or something, 6,000. I have no idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got more than 1000 of you listening, and I know that you wanna come and help Anne cuz she&#8217;s a delight. I know you wanna come help Brian cuz he&#8217;s a delight. Both of you. This was such a fun conversation. Thank you for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:27:29]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you, Josepha. Thank you, Anne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:27:31]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:27:33]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there it is a bit of a deep dive on the Test Team and how to get started on it. Like I mentioned, we&#8217;ll have a ton of links in the show notes over on wordpress.org/news. And I wanna remind folks that if you have questions or thoughts that you&#8217;d like to hear from me about, you can always email us at WPbriefing@wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:27:58]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. First and foremost, we are counting down the days to the WordPress 6.1 release. We are within a month of the target release date. So if you have not tested the latest version with your plugins or themes, now is the time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, we are seeing translated tutorials being submitted on learn.wordpress.org. I&#8217;m delighted to see that happening, and I encourage any polyglots out there who feel called to consider translating one into your language and help other people feel empowered to use WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing is that the WordPress Speaker Workshop for Women Voices in India just concluded, so to celebrate, we&#8217;ve opened registrations for the WordPress Speaker Workshop for Women Voices in Latin America. Unlike the last one, this event takes place in person on October 29th. And so I&#8217;ll include a link to registrations for that in the show notes as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosey, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13551\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"WordPress 6.1 Beta 2 Now Available\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/09/wordpress-6-1-beta-2-now-available/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 18:12:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"6.1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13533\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:306:\"WordPress 6.1 Beta 2 is now available for download and testing.\n\nThis version of the WordPress software is under development.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:41]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For folks who are new to WordPress in the past couple of years, you may have heard people talk about WordPress events with a sort of passion that really is hard to describe. For me, I know our events are the dark matter of what makes this global, fully distributed, multifaceted project come together so well in the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also know that WordPressers have so many different reasons for coming together. So we took a little wander through WordCamp US to get their take on why they use WordPress and also why they go to WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:13]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So WordCamp US is back in person for the first time since 2019. What are you most excited about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Topher 00:01:19]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am Topher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing everyone, the interpersonal relationships, the communication, the expressions on people&#8217;s faces that you don&#8217;t get via email or Slack or whatever. Just being near people again and enjoying each other&#8217;s company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jen Miller 00:01:35]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Jen Miller.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was most excited to see my friends. It&#8217;s been a long time to try to maintain connections via social media and, you know, texting and phone calls. But being here and being a part of the WordPress community has made everything great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Courtney Robertson 00:01:54]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney Robertson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributor day, of course, that&#8217;s how I got really connected to the WordPress community. And I am hoping we have a great turnout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:02]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How long have you been a contributor to WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Kathy Drewien 00:02:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Kathy Drewien.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started in 2008 by attending my first WordCamp. Two years later, I was part of the organizing team for WordCamp Atlanta. I have been on that team for one role or another. Well, I can&#8217;t tell you how many years now. From then, until now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Stine 00:02:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Alex Stine. About six years now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Topher 00:02:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>About 12 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started going to WordCamp, then working in the support forums, and just grew from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Courtney Robertson 00:02:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started checking guests in, at my first WordCamp in 2009, which I see as one avenue of contributing. I joined a team officially in 2014.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Courtney Patubo Kranzke </strong><strong>00:02:47]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Courtney Patubo Kranzke.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been an on-and-off contributor to WordPress since like the mid-2000s, but I&#8217;ve been a sponsored contributor since 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Dustin Hartzler </strong><strong>00:03:02]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Dustin Hartzler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started a WordPress podcast in 2010. And I did like 500 episodes in a row without a break and without a week worth of rest. So I consider that my contribution to WordPress. I have a couple of core contributions, like I, I fixed a little bug here, a little bug there in a couple of releases, I think back in the four eras, 4.1 or 4.2 or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2010 is when I really got started in giving back, and, like, sharing my knowledge with the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:03:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is it important for you to attend WordCamps or contribute to the WordPress project?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Ricardas Kudirka </strong><strong>00:03:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Ricardas Kudirka.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, for everyone who&#8217;s using WordPress, it&#8217;s really important to understand how big the community is that we have here. So the community is an important and crucial part of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for it to grow, you need to attend the WordCamps, you need to share knowledge, and you need to meet people. So networking here and while meeting the exciting people who are developing WordPress or who are contributing to it, who are providing the services, who enable people to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a crucial point for everyone to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Kathy Drewien </strong><strong>00:04:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to attend them because it&#8217;s very hard to describe them. We are not like any other thing you have ever done in your life. You have to be here to get it. And then once you get it, you wanna do more of it. It&#8217;s magical. It&#8217;s magical. There&#8217;s no way to get that experience without being here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of contributing, it&#8217;s a responsible thing to do. You want to give back instead of get, get, get. In the beginning, we&#8217;re all about the get, get, get. And then you go, oh my gosh. I didn&#8217;t know. I didn&#8217;t know I could do this. I didn&#8217;t know I had to write code. I can actually just stand around and talk to people and contribute to the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Jen Miller </strong><strong>00:04:50]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it&#8217;s a community effort, and so if we want it to progress and grow, we need to put our own individual effort into the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, we make friends, we make connections, and we find people who we can help and who can help us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Alex Stine </strong><strong>00:05:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel it is important to support the community that got me my start in technology and make sure that people understand that accessibility is very much a requirement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, we need to make sure we keep the community inclusive for all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:05:21]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is your favorite way to WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Courtney Patubo Kranzke </strong><strong>00:05:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started with WordPress as a personal blogger. So it continues to be my favorite way to use WordPress. But, my use has evolved to using it for work as well as a place to share my photography and food blogging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Courtney Robertson </strong><strong>00:05:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite way to WordPress is through the Training team. Most of the things that I write these days are on make.wordpress.org/training and or learn.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love teaching people about WordPress, helping people at all skill levels advance, and that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll find me around the WordPress Training team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Dustin&nbsp; Hartzler </strong><strong>00:05:59]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite way to WordPress is just building cool things. Like I have a website, my wife has a couple of websites, and me just trying to learn things and trying to do them myself. Yesterday, there was a session, a 15-minute long session, and I learned how to customize the options available for different core WordPress blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn&#8217;t realize that you could just make a button and like make a default like here&#8217;s the style for the default button. So every button&#8217;s exactly the same on the site. Like how cool is that? I like the side of customizing WordPress to make it easier for people who are non-techy like me to use my site, like my wife, and whatnot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:06:30]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you use WordPress in your day-to-day life?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Topher </strong><strong>00:06:32]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s sort of a universal tool for me. I blog, and I do podcasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I enjoy drinking whiskey, so I built a rating system for it. And I use it as a notepad, a scratch pad. I use it as my photography backup system. Just kind of as a universal tool for everything</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Alex Stine </strong><strong>00:06:53]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I currently am one of the Accessibility team reps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a core contributor, Guttenberg contributor, the occasional meta contributor, and the occasional training team contributor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:07:05]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, if that doesn&#8217;t convince you to go to a WordCamp or start your own meetup group, I just don&#8217;t know what will. Big thanks to everyone who sat down with us there in San Diego.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:23]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it&#8217;s time for our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First thing, WordPress Global Translation Day is coming up next week on September 28th. This is a great opportunity to learn more about the hard work that goes into translating all of this software for folks all around the world. If you want to learn more about how you could contribute to translations, I&#8217;ll have a link in the show notes for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that WooSesh is coming up on October 11th through 13th, 2022. This one is not an in-person event. It&#8217;s a WPSessions event, but it specifically talks about how to get some eCommerce going on your WordPress site. So if you&#8217;ve been thinking about how to get a shop on your site, or just making your current shop a bit more complicated, then this is the event for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing on our list today is All Things Open. They are hosting a hybrid event this year from October 31st through November 2nd. This event isn&#8217;t specific to WordPress, but it is specific to open source and one of the best resources for learning some OSS basics. So if you&#8217;ve been interested in learning more about how this whole open source thing is an idea that will change our generation, then set your sights on that event. I will have a link in the show notes there as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13481\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"Dropping security updates for WordPress versions 3.7 through 4.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/09/dropping-security-updates-for-wordpress-versions-3-7-through-4-0/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Sep 2022 13:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Updates\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13466\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:343:\"As of December 1, 2022 the WordPress Security Team will no longer provide security updates for WordPress versions 3.7 through 4.0.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Helping people who are new to WordPress learn how to make the most out of their CMS used to be one of the most clearly impactful things I ever did as a contributor. Whether it was making sure a brand new installation simply worked, or if the original setup needed to grow along with a solopreneur&#8217;s growing business needs, I found great joy in seeing how my local community was learning new tools together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard me talk about the Learn WP initiative or the training team on this podcast before, but you might still be a little shy to get started with the team. So I have invited one of their team reps today to talk through what the team does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. I have with us today Hauwa Abashiya. She is one of the team reps for the training team and also works on the learn.wordpress.org site. Thank you for joining me today, Hauwa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:01:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And thank you for having me, Josepha, quite exciting to be on your podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:37]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I, you know, when we were talking about doing this topic, I was like, you know, who would be an excellent person is Hauwa. Like you were such an interesting person to work with when we were working on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/12/simone/\">5.6 release</a>. And then also, you just have such a lovely way of explaining the complicated things that we have going on in WordPress and especially on the training side of things. And so you were the first person that came to mind for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:02:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of all the learn.wordpress.org things, you&#8217;ve been contributing to the WordPress project as a team rep for the training team for a bit. But that&#8217;s not really where you started. Can you tell me a bit about how you found your way to this team?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:02:15]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I started by attending a WordCamp, and that was WordCamp Brighton. And if anyone&#8217;s read my <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/finding-my-global-family/\">article on HeroPress</a>, then they will know that I learned WordPress in one week. Went through beginner sessions of it. And then, I was like, yeah, let me just go turn up and see what it&#8217;s like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So turned up, and I met some wonderful people there. One of them being <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/miss_jwo/\">Jenny Wong</a>, who introduced me to the London meetup team. So, I then went there. They were looking for volunteers because they were planning WordCamp London for 2019. And me being me, I was like, yeah, sure. Why not? And got thrown into the deep end, but no, an amazing team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got to meet some really amazing people. And yeah, just went from there then, you know, because I was doing stuff with WordCamp London, ended up going to WordCamp Europe. And I think there&#8217;s probably quite a lot of people who say they fully got into contributing in WordCamp Europe. So I was doing little bits and pieces then on like, marketing team and then met <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jessecowens/\">Jesse [Owens]</a>  at the training team cause <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">Abha Thakor</a> introduced me to him and just went from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then in terms of team rep, I mean, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/courane01/\">Courtney Robertson</a> sent out SOS, because Learn had just launched, and there were a couple of things that we needed. So that was during the soft launch. And I was like, yeah, sure. I&#8217;ll help you. I&#8217;m not doing much. And that&#8217;s how I ended up doing team rep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:46]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love that so many initial stories in the WordPress community start with like, well, I went to a WordCamp cause I was like, what in the world is this? And then people were like, we need some help. And I thought to myself, what else am I doing? Like, so many stories start that way. And I just love it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:04:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you mentioned learn.wordpress.org. That is a part of the training team in the WordPress project. Correct?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So can you give us an idea of the difference between the two? Cause like normally, with a project as big as Learn, you would expect to see like a whole separate team. But these are two intertwined teams using two intertwined concepts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so can you give us an idea of the difference between them?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:04:29]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I like to see learners, that&#8217;s the content. So it&#8217;s the content that we have on the platform, and the training team wrangles all the content on Learn. So that would be like your videos, your lesson plans, and online workshops. Yeah, so we wrangle the content that&#8217;s on there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We try to bring a lot of different teams together, and that&#8217;s one of the things the beauty, I think, of Learn is that there is a lot of cross-team collaboration, which started from the beginning and I think just will continue and get better and better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And the workshops, those are once a week, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:05:04]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So you have online workshops, which used to be called social learning spaces, which used to be called discussion groups. So those run once a week. There&#8217;s a number running, and there are some that are launching in Japan. And I think <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/bsanevans/\">Ben Evans</a> has been quite key in getting quite a lot of those going, and I think <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/piyopiyofox/\">Destiny Kanno</a> as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that&#8217;s the beauty is you get to see a lot more languages coming up. Those run once a week. And then we obviously have lesson plans, which traditionally that&#8217;s what the training team used to always make for Meetup organizers. So if you didn&#8217;t have a speaker, you could go and get a lesson plan and run through something, or anybody could pick one up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they are used mainly by like our Meetup users and then people who are running any boot camps or sessions, or you wanna just take somebody through WordPress and teach them, you can pick one up and run through it. And now we&#8217;ve got courses on Learn, which is quite exciting. Got a couple of courses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know there&#8217;s about three or four courses in development. There is a bit more WordPress development based rather than user based. There&#8217;s a fourth piece of content, and that is just the general workshop. So tutorials, I think no tutorials is what we&#8217;re calling them now. So there&#8217;s like all our online videos.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:17]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tell you terminology in any project, the age and size of WordPress is hard to keep everything straight, but especially when you&#8217;ve just changed it you&#8217;re like, what do we call it though?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:06:27]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if I understand correctly, because as you mentioned, like you have this post up on HeroPress, you don&#8217;t actually come from a training background. Like you aren&#8217;t a teacher or corporate trainer or anything, but you have really committed to contributing to the training team and to learn.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, from your perspective, from like the, I&#8217;m not a trainer perspective, what&#8217;s the most exciting thing for learn.wordpress.org in the near future?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:06:58]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s the collaboration. It&#8217;s the potential that Learn has. So I don&#8217;t have a training background, but interestingly enough, I come from Kaduna, Nigeria. And Kaduna cause all the states in Nigeria have a tagline, and, Kaduna is actually the center of learning. So there must be some link there, so yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I think the beauty of that is you don&#8217;t have to have a training background. You can come in and impart your knowledge, and there are people available in the team that can help you impart that knowledge. So if it&#8217;s like a lesson plan that you wanna draw up, we&#8217;ve got people that can help and assist in that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you wanna run an online workshop. There are people that can assist you. And I think that&#8217;s also the beauty of WordPress is that we&#8217;re all there to help each other. So just seeing that and seeing how, as time has gone on how the team has actually just been growing cause more and more people are coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then with that, you&#8217;ve got more of like the different languages coming in, and I know we might touch on that later, but it&#8217;s, I think to me, that is the beauty that anyone can actually now come in and learn. And Learn as this platform that is accessible to everybody. So it&#8217;s not necessarily behind a, like a paywall or anything, which is, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that, but there are people that it&#8217;s like, well, okay, you can access something by the community for the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think like your last thought there, something that&#8217;s by the community for the community. That&#8217;s one of the things that I noticed early on about the WordPress community. So I&#8217;ve been in the WordPress community for a long time, but when I started doing the administrative back office, things that are invisible and no one wants to know about, because it&#8217;s boring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I started doing that work, one of the things I noticed and that I really treasure the most about the WordPress community is that they want to do things together. They want to look at the problem together. They want to find a solution together. And a lot of times they just want to learn together as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We see that there is a real, I don&#8217;t know, not, it&#8217;s not a safety and numbers question. I think it is a long-standing feeling that we can all kind of get further together and that we are better together. And so I like your thought there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You mentioned, though, translations, and I know that this came up at WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don&#8217;t actually have a lot of translated content on learn.wordpress.org. There&#8217;s some technical issues that exist there, but are there a few languages that we already are sort of seeing translated courses for? Translated lessons for?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:09:47]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So we have a couple in Hindi, I believe. And I know we&#8217;ve got some Greek translations that have been coming up, so I know, I think it was last year WordCamp India, during contributor day, we had quite a lot of people translating stuff then, and I suppose the online WordCamps that we&#8217;ve been able to rank. Cause I think our first like face to face is this year, so they didn&#8217;t do that much translation there, but we&#8217;ve seen an increase in people wanting to translate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think those are the ones that come to mind. And I know Japanese, I think that was just recently, in the last two weeks, somebody&#8217;s translated one or two of the tutorials have been translated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we’re getting more and more requests coming through. And I know we kind of touched on this in our earlier discussion, but it&#8217;s like, how do you manage that? Cause you&#8217;re right, we don&#8217;t have a way to easily manage polyglots on Learn at the moment or WordPress in general. But I think seeing that, and I keep saying to people, I don&#8217;t wanna lose that engagement cause if you&#8217;ve got the people engaged, let them just do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t normally say this, but let them do it, and we&#8217;ll figure out how to sort out the whole pile when it comes in later. Because you kind of don&#8217;t want to lose them because I feel like if we say, no, we&#8217;ll wait until that comes in, we&#8217;ll lose a lot of the engagement. And come that time, people will be like, oh no, I&#8217;m not that interested. Or it might be an even more effort to try and bring more people on board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:18]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s always a struggle, like wanting to be able to get something good out without insisting that it be perfect. Like that whole perfect is the enemy of the good sort of concept.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:11:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Mm-hmm&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we were talking about this way back in June, I was like, I obviously would love to get a perfect solution out immediately, but like, you&#8217;re right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, do we just be if you don&#8217;t speak English, you cannot learn here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like that&#8217;s not fair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:11:45]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:46]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We want everyone to be able to learn here in their own languages, and yeah. That&#8217;s just a living, breathing issue with a global project, I think.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:11:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:57]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we left us on like a really juicy topic, just the lightest thing we could find. Is there anything else that you wanna be sure to share with the WordPress Briefing listeners before we head out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:12:10]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Come and join the training team. Like I said, you don&#8217;t have to be a trainer. You can come in, and help us take notes. You can come in and edit, and review. If you are a subject matter expert, we also have the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/handbook/faculty-program/\">faculty program</a>, which was launched. Was it a month ago now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorry. Days, months, weeks merge for me these days. But yeah, so that&#8217;s like a dedicated volunteer team. And in there, we&#8217;ve got content creators, editors, subject matter experts, and just admin stuff. If you wanna help us with the admin stuff. If you&#8217;re a GitHub guru, get in touch cause we are trying to automate some of our processes, and we could use the help, but yeah, just come join us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join one of our meetings, which run on Tuesdays at 7 AM UTC and 4:00 PM UTC.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, that&#8217;s right. I get my time right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:03]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it&#8217;s not right, we&#8217;ll put it. We&#8217;ll correct it in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, if you are not necessarily familiar with the WordPress project and how to get started with contributions, you can find the training team and a lot of information about them and all the other teams on make.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will share that in the show notes as well. make.wordpress.org/training is where you can find Hauwa&#8217;s team. Hauwa, thank you again for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:13:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, thank you for having me. It&#8217;s just a wonderful treat. I get to listen to you, and now I get to be on it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, it&#8217;s good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that some of you feel inspired to stop by and see what the team is up to learn something new about WordPress or contribute a little something yourself. And with that, I&#8217;ll bring us home with the small list of big things. First thing, there was a freshly pressed minor release last week. You probably didn&#8217;t notice it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It probably went quite smoothly in the background and never interrupted you at all. However, if you want to read what was in it, you can head to wordpress.org/news now, or click on the link in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second thing, is that coming up at the end of this week, September 9th, 2022, WordCamp US is back and ready to help broaden your WordPress knowledge. If you will be there, I hope it is a wonderful time, but if you won&#8217;t be there in person, I&#8217;ll include a link to register for the live stream, or you can watch all of those sessions afterward on wp.tv or the WordPress YouTube channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third thing on our list of small list of big things is that WordPress Translation Day is coming up. That&#8217;s normally at the end of September, it coincides with a global day of appreciation for translators just generally across the world. And so that is coming, it&#8217;s normally around the 28th or so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:55]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So put that in your calendars. As soon as I have any information, as soon as I have a link to share with you all, I will have that for you as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing on my list today is that if you are hoping to speak at WordCamp Asia, 2023, you have 10 more days, September 15th, 2022**, to apply for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need topics of all sorts, from security hardening and backend development to entrepreneurial best practices, WordPress out of the box all the way back around to the importance of securing open source freedom. Even when people don&#8217;t know they need them. If you&#8217;ve got something you&#8217;re a bit passionate about, something that you are a passionate expert about especially, we want to see your application. And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>** <em><strong>Special note: the deadline to apply as a speaker to WordCamp Asia was extended to September 30th, 2022, after the recording of this episode.</strong></em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13425\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"People of WordPress: Bud Kraus\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/08/people-of-wordpress-bud-kraus/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 21:30:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:6:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Features\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Interviews\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"HeroPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"People of WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13385\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:135:\"The latest People of WordPress story features trainer Bud Kraus, from the United States, talking about the software and how he uses it.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"webcommsat AbhaNonStopNewsUK\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14109:\"\n<p><strong>This month, as we approach <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2022/\">WordCamp US</a>, we feature Bud Kraus, a WordPress trainer who has made a career in helping others learn about software.

He was determined not to let his sight difficulties stop him from his wish to  help others learn website building and maintenance skills.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As WordPress evolves and new features release, Bud decided to extend his training services around helping new and existing users improve and practice their skills. He supports others in open source through volunteering to speak at WordPress events, and encourages others to do so too. He also gives time to help produce material for the free-to-access resource <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress,</a> which is part of the WordPress.org project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a contributor to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/\">Test</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/\">Training</a> teams, Bud is keen for others to try contributing to these areas and help support the project&#8217;s future development. One of his current training priorities is to help people with using the block editor and Full Site Editing. He is an advocate for the usability of WordPress today, saying: “I can design all aspects of a website now with a block.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Using WordPress as a traditional developer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud’s WordPress journey began with a lunch at Grand Central Station in New York in 2009. A friend and former client was promoting the idea of using WordPress, which Bud initially resisted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’m a code guy…,” he told his friend at the time. “I will never use anything like that.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the friend persisted. Eventually, Bud gave it a try and found a new approach with things called themes and plugins. His first encounter was with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/releases/\">WordPress 2.6</a>. Bud signed up with a hosting company and found a theme where he could learn to edit and understand child themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;Once I saw that you could edit anything and make it yours, I was hooked. The endorphins were freely coursing through my veins.&#8221; Bud was hooked.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Teaching WordPress strengthens your own understanding of the software</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s an old saying that the best way to learn something new is to turn around and teach someone else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud was already an instructor at the Fashion Institute of Technology when he thought, “I could teach WordPress!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so he did, packing classrooms all through those first years of WordPress as it swept through the design world and further.<br><br>But Bud had more to discover. He said: &#8220;Two big things were about to happen that were really going to change my life. They would show me the way to the WordPress community – not that I even knew what that was.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sharing lessons learnt with the WordPress community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2014, one of his students suggested he start going to the New York WordPress Meetup.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As he started going to WordCamps in New York City, he realized that WordPress was getting very large. What’s more, it had a community of people with whom he felt at home and could learn alongside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud gave a talk for the first time in 2016 at the only WordCamp to this day that has been held at the United Nations. He shared his knowledge of “Lessons Learned: Considerations For Teaching Your Clients WordPress.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"952\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?resize=952%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Bud Kraus talking at a WordCamp\" class=\"wp-image-13340\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?w=952&amp;ssl=1 952w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?resize=279%2C300&amp;ssl=1 279w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?resize=768%2C826&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 952px) 100vw, 952px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Bud Kraus speaks at WordCamps to help people use the software even more effectively</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, Bud went on to speak at other WordCamps in the US. He also volunteered as a speaker wrangler for his home camp in New York City in 2018 and 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>From speaking to writing about WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At some point before the Covid-19 lockdown, Bud found another outlet, this time in writing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud heard a magazine was advertising for submissions related to WordPress.&nbsp;His first attempted article did not make the cut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in his second submission, Bud took the risk of writing about something deeply personal – a topic he really didn’t want to write about at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He gathered his courage and revealed to the entire web design world that he was legally blind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The article appeared as&nbsp; <strong>“</strong><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/05/using-low-vision-teach-wordpress/\"><strong>Using Low Vision As My Tool To Help Me Teach WordPress</strong></a><strong>”.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"510\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/bud-kraus-2.jpg?resize=510%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Bud Kraus\" class=\"wp-image-13426\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/bud-kraus-2.jpg?w=510&amp;ssl=1 510w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/bud-kraus-2.jpg?resize=255%2C300&amp;ssl=1 255w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Bud Kraus</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the age of 37, Bud has had macular degeneration in both eyes, which affects his central vision. It is a leading cause of legal blindness in the United States and many other countries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He relies on his peripheral vision and finding ways to compensate. He also tends to see things in a flat dimension and has a difficulty discerning contrast&nbsp; &#8211; he&nbsp; is glad there are starting to be improvements in color contrasts in web design!<br><br>He uses tools like Speech to Text, larger sized cursors and bigger font sizes, and heavily uses zooming back in and out when working with WordPress. He is able to recognize patterns but has to rely on detailed preparation and memorizing materials.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his first magazine article acknowledging this situation, he shared the added difficulties that technology creates for people with visual conditions, and tips that he had found to try and find alternative routes around them. He uses the technique of finding alternatives in his training work to help people learn and understand, realizing that all people have different ways of reading and understanding. His words and subsequent stories have inspired others and enabled more people to highlight accessibility. He describes himself as a ‘stakeholder in ensuring that the WordPress admin is accessible.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year after its first publication, the piece became a WordCamp talk, ‘My Way with WordPress.’ The talk was a hit and started many conversations about accessibility and the importance of raising awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months later, he gave a Gutenberg talk at the first WordCamp Montclair. There was no way he could have done it from a laptop, so instead, he did it from his 27” desktop computer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud said: &#8220;It was a presentation on Gutenberg plugins. Since I couldn’t do this from a notebook screen (the screen is too small and the keyboard is hard for me to manipulate), it was decided that I would bring in my 27″ desktop machine to a WordCamp. I’m probably the first person to ever have done this. It was good thing I only lived a few miles away.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “I sat behind my computer, did my thing, and every once in a while peered out to make sure people were still there.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Different ways of contributing to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main ways Bud supported the community around the software was through talks at WordCamps and helping others to speak. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, he was keen to continue contributing when WordCamps were no longer meeting in person. He turned greater attention to supporting the <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress</a> resource, a free to use learning platform made by and for the community itself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More training materials on the block editor can be found on Learn WordPress and his WordCamp talks are available on <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/?s=kraus&amp;speakers=bud-kraus\">WordPress.tv</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Global reach and meaning through WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-with-josepha.jpg?resize=600%2C800&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Bud Kraus with Josepha\" class=\"wp-image-13342\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-with-josepha.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-with-josepha.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Bud Kraus with Josepha Haden Chomphosy at WordCamp Montclair, NJ 2022</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud’s training materials and willingness to talk about accessibility have helped so many people find their way with WordPress. He in turn is an advocate for the community around open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “The software is really good, and the people are even better.” &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “I get a sense of accomplishment whenever I launch a new or redesigned site. It’s also given me a great feeling to know that many people have learned WordPress around the world from my <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/?s=kraus&amp;speakers=bud-kraus\">talks and presentations</a>.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing: the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today is one of my favorite niche holidays &#8211; World Wide Web Day &#8211; which serves to raise awareness about the origins of the World Wide Web project. WordPress, as part of Web 2.0, only ever had a chance to exist because the web, as we have come to know it exists. So in order to mark this nerdy day on the WP Briefing, I invited a number of community members to share a bit about how WordPress has been a part of their lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first, let&#8217;s do some introductions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Warner 00:01:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/awarner20/\">Adam Warner</a>, and I&#8217;m originally from a small town in west Michigan, now residing in Orlando, Florida.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alice Orrù 00:01:15]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/aliceorru/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/aliceorru/\">Alice Orrù</a>. I&#8217;m Italian. I was born in the beautiful island of Sardinia, but I&#8217;ve been living in Spain in the province of Barcelona for 10 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Dee Teal 00:01:26]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/thewebprincess/\">Dee Teal</a>; Dee is short for Denise. I&#8217;m from New Zealand, but I live In Melbourne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Femy Praseeth 00:01:33]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, my name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/femkreations/\">Femy Praseeth</a>. I was born and raised in India and now live in San Jose, California, with my family and cuddly Doodle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jill Binder 00:01:41]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jillbinder/\">Jill Binder</a>, and I&#8217;ve just moved back to Vancouver, Canada.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Mary Job 00:01:47]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/mariaojob/\">Mary Job</a>. I&#8217;ve been using WordPress since 2015, and I&#8217;m from Nigeria. I&#8217;m from the Western part of Nigeria. Ijebu precisely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Oneal Rosero 00:01:57]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/onealtr/\">Oneal Rosero</a>. I am from the Philippines and I&#8217;ve been using WordPress since 2007.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Theophilus Adegbohungbe</strong> <strong>00:02:06]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you. My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/iamsirotee/\">Theophilus Adegbohungbe</a> . And I&#8217;m from Ilesa, Osun State in Nigeria.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Ugyen Dorji 00:02:14]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ugyensupport/\">Ugyen Dorji</a> and I&#8217;m from Bhutan. And I&#8217;m working with WordPress for more than five years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:22]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I enjoy the most about being part of any community is being able to see how people change and grow over time as they learn and gain confidence in their own expertise. So a favorite early question is naturally, ‘How has WordPress changed your World?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alice Orrù 00:02:37]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress changed my world in many ways. But, uh, starting from the moment, it allowed me to become part of a global connected and welcome community. I started using WordPress as a blogger many, many years ago, but it was in 2015 that I started working behind the scenes of WordPress with a plugin company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was the moment when everything changed, basically, because I realized that WordPress was much more than a CMS for creating websites. It was a world full of opportunities for networking, making new friends and walking a new professional path as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Ugyen Dorji 00:03:15]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>During one interview, I was asked many questions about WordPress and although I had a basic understanding of WordPress, I struggled to give detailed answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that interview, I resolved to develop my skills and learn as much about WordPress as possible. A few months passed and I received a call from ServeMask In, [who] had developed a plugin called All-in-One WP Migration plugin. They offered me a position which fulfilled my wish to work with WordPress full time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because of that, I am now an active contributor to the WordPress community as bread and butter, with the best career in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Theophilus Adegbohungbe 00:04:03]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are very familiar with my country, Nigeria things here, it&#8217;s not as smooth as it is in other parts of the world. That is, when you are done in school in my university, you have to find means of surviving yourself.&nbsp; There is nothing like the government have work for you. There is nothing like you finish our institution and you get job instantly. So it&#8217;s very tough here. And, year by year, schools keep producing graduates with no companies to employ them and no government job again as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I personally, I was able to gain freedom from this with the help of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Femy Praseeth 00:04:51]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress completely changed my work life. I started working independently. I started freelancing with agencies and designers and, uh, building websites from their web designs. And this was around the time my son was born. Actually, he was in elementary school and I think this was around 2014 or so. I started working remotely when remote was not even a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there were very few companies that let you work from home and remote was not a mainstream thing at all, but with WordPress, I could set my own working hours while my son was in school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:29]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, my preferred follow-up question of, ‘How did you hear about us?’ or ‘How did you connect to this global community?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Oneal Rosero 00:05:36]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, actually what I love about WordPress is that it&#8217;s a community. It&#8217;s not a business. It&#8217;s not a company. It&#8217;s a community. It&#8217;s a community that&#8217;s always ready to help support, teach and encourage people. That&#8217;s how I felt when I joined the community. There&#8217;s always somebody who has your back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s always somebody who&#8217;s going to guide you. There&#8217;s always an expert who will take your hand and lead you into the beauty that is WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Warner 00:06:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way that I connect with the global community these days are one, of course, is .org Slack. Another of course is Twitter as there&#8217;s a very active WordPress community there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then with WordCamps all over the globe. I&#8217;m lucky enough to have been able to travel to several hundred WordCamps through the years in the US and abroad. And that&#8217;s one of the most rewarding parts is meeting people from all over the world and you see really how small and the world really is and how similar we really all are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Theophilus Adegbohungbe 00:06:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, not until 2020. I don’t know if you know this lady, a very vibrant lady in WordPress. She&#8217;s from Nigeria; her name is Mary Job, and she&#8217;s really promoting WordPress here. So it was through her that I got to know about the community. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jill Binder 00:06:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My work is the global WordPress community. So we hold our three programs for the global WordPress community, and we are always trying to reach more and more countries. For quite a while, it was very North America-heavy, and then I made some efforts to expand. And it&#8217;s very exciting that this year, some contributors in our team have actually launched an Asia Pacific branch of our group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we have two meetings every other week where we have the America/Europe and the APAC, and we&#8217;ve also been able to reach other countries as well, but we typically reach something like between 20 and 50 countries a year, depending on the year. So a hundred percent global. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How has WordPress, either the CMS or the project, made you feel more connected? And are there any surprising connections that came from WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Dee Teal&nbsp; 00:07:47]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess the surprising connections I think that have come from WordPress have been the fact that I feel like I&#8217;ve got friends all over the world. And a lot of those have come out of community involvement and from contributing. That I could go to a, a meetup pretty much anywhere in the world and probably find somebody I know, or at least a second degree connection of somebody that I haven&#8217;t, you know, that I might not have met, but know somebody that I know. And certainly that happens fairly regularly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Mary Job 00:08:13]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress. The WordPress project, the community, has made me feel connected in a huge way, because I am literally surrounded by everything WordPress. So I like how, when you meet somebody who does WordPress, there&#8217;s this instant, ‘Oh, we&#8217;re brothers,’ or&nbsp; ‘Oh, we&#8217;re sisters!’ You know? There&#8217;s that feeling? That&#8217;s how I feel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when I see somebody who does WordPress, as I do, I&#8217;m like, ‘Oh yeah, we&#8217;re, kin.’ You know? We are family. That&#8217;s how I feel when I meet people who do WordPress. And I&#8217;ve met quite a number of people who do WordPress from like around the world. Like I have a friend here, he&#8217;s from the Benin Republic, and we host started a dinner on Friday night and one of my guests was asking me, ‘How did you guys meet?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was like, ‘Oh yeah, we work in the same WordPress ecosystem.’ He attended our WordCamp, we became friends, and we just literally became really good friends. So I have tons of people that I&#8217;ve met like that I hold in high esteem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Ugyen Dorji 00:09:12]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress Meetups are the seeds that lead to the growth of WordPress communities. WordCamp is a platform for plugin and theme developers to meet WordPress users and website developers. It&#8217;s a great environment where many incredible discussions about WordPress takes place. With each WordCamp there is a &#8220;tribe&#8221; meeting, where I think people [can] get more connected. It&#8217;s a fantastic opportunity for aspiring computer engineers, generators and get to showcase their talent and meet each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alice Orrù 00:09:51]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the project level, it has given me the opportunity to feel like an active part of a global project. The idea that I can give my contribution to making the web a better place &#8211; it’s amazing. And I do so with the Translation team, so making WordPress accessible to all the people that use the core plugins and themes in Italian, and prefer to do that in Italian.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:18]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What area of the WordPress world is most important to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jill Binder 00:10:21]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a little bit of a passion for diversity in tech and diversity in WordPress, specifically around events. And so, here&#8217;s a chance to name the three programs that we&#8217;ve been working on this year. So as mentioned a few times, we have our <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/diversity-speaker-training-workshop/\">Diverse Speaker Workshop</a> that helps people go from not even having the thought that people could step up on stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the second program is because of the pandemic. There was no longer the straight path from taking our workshop to speaking, because we used to hold them or people used to hold them for their WordCamps and meetups. And so it was like, okay, you&#8217;ve taken. Apply for our next WordCamp or meetup. But during the pandemic, that wasn&#8217;t a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have this amazing channel that we welcome everyone to join, allies and people from underrepresented groups who are interested in speaking or interested in supporting people and speaking. And that&#8217;s the Diverse Speaker channel <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C028SE81N3H\">diverse-speaker-support</a> channel on the Make WordPress slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third program is, and we, we went through a name change recently. So I&#8217;ll try to remember the new change it&#8217;s Organizing Inclusive and Diverse WordPress Events. And this is for WordCamp and meetup organizers to learn. We&#8217;ve learned over the last couple years, how important it is to create inclusive spaces and be good allies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how do we actually do that? And a few of us created a very action oriented workshop in 2019 for WCUS, and that is now the basis of the work that we are bringing to people and people are loving it.. We&#8217;ve had people report a 40%, self-report 40%, increase in feeling prepared to create an inclusive event from before and after taking that workshop, which is super cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So, that’s my passion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Oneal Rosero 00:12:13]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really love helping the WP Diversity team. I love running the workshops. I love running the workshops for myself, because I used to do training for software back before the pandemic. I used to train up to a thousand people a year in person, sometimes like 500 people in a room at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But of course I had to shift. I had to pivot to online training, which is what the training team has brought for me. And the focus on the diversity. I like running the workshops. I like running workshops for different groups, different countries, because it&#8217;s nice to meet new people. It&#8217;s nice to hear about their culture, about the limitations that people have in Africa with connectivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they, they resort to using WhatsApp on their phone in order to do a meetup. That&#8217;s how they do their, their meetings, their discussions. It&#8217;s unlike other countries where we can do video calls. They have to use their mobile phones because connectivity isn&#8217;t accessible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Places like in the Philippines that get affected when it starts to rain a little bit, we lose our internet. So we have backups and our backups have backups. So there are many things that you learn that are different when you&#8217;re living in the city, when you&#8217;re living in the provinces, in the country. So it&#8217;s so many things that you learn about people and how they&#8217;re able to adapt.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Warner 00:13:35]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enabling end users to reach their goals. And whether that means participating in contributing to the software, to the Core software itself, in terms of UI/UX usability. That can include participating in the community and sharing your knowledge proactively with users who may be new to the platform, or have used WordPress for a while, but now want to step up their game, get a little deeper into using their websites as a tool for growth, for whatever business that they&#8217;re in. So, I mean, overall, the, the most important part of the WordPress world to me are the end users. And, you know, there, there is this quote unquote inner circle of WordPress community people. People who are involved in .org, people who contribute to the software, people who contribute to the 20 plus make.wordpress.org teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those we have to keep in mind, are not the average user by and far. They are not the typical user that hears the word WordPress and then goes out and searches it and then has to figure out how to use it. So I think user experience is probably the most important part for me and making sure that any of that innate knowledge that we have in that inner circle of WordPress because many of us have been using it for so long, keeping in mind that is not the norm. And it&#8217;s not the scale at which WordPress is used and, and making sure we translate complex concepts down to a layperson&#8217;s terms that might not be as familiar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:17]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that I have always found so fascinating about the web and WordPress’ role in it is how it has made the world simultaneously smaller and bigger. By giving voices to the voiceless we help each other find our community niches regardless of where they are in the world. Some of your closest friends could be people you would never meet in your own neighborhood. Well, let’s hear what some of our community members had to say about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Dee Tea 00:15:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the thing that has been most empowering is, is coming into the project either in terms of contributing time and efforts to the community, which is where most of my contribution has been &#8211; has always been about this is a really cool thing, and I really want to build this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I&#8217;ll put my time and efforts into building WordPress. Not for me, but because I see its value and I see its community and I see that the contribution that it&#8217;s making to the world and I, and that&#8217;s really important. But finding that on the other side of that was a huge amount of personal benefit for me in my career, in the friendships that I&#8217;ve made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I feel like if I had been approaching the community with, I want a better career, I wanna meet all of these people and I want, and I want all of this. From, “I want” for me, instead of, I want for this project, for the community and effectively for the world with that, you know, that whole democratized, the democratizing of publishing is this thing that serves the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s been the key for me is that I absolutely have reaped amazing benefits from it, but it came out of that sense of, I see this value here and I want to contribute to that because it&#8217;s gonna have value, not just for me, but for a whole slew of people. And so, uh, you know, for much, much bigger impact than just on me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think that&#8217;s the important thing for me is that sense of, if you approach it with that attitude of what can I do to help? It&#8217;s amazing what you will find yourself helped with in return.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:17:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that you enjoyed this tour of WordPress in the World Wide Web. I want to share a big thank you to all of the folks who contributed to our little WordPress Briefing celebration of World Wide Web Day today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. So firstly, we&#8217;ve got a couple of updates from our upcoming flagship events. WordCamp US has announced a speaker support fund specifically for historically underrepresented speakers at the event. You can donate to the fund on the page if you&#8217;d like, and there are also directions on how to request support, if you are part of an underrepresented group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the folks over at WordCamp Asia, the call for speakers is live. That&#8217;s taking place in February, 2023. But it&#8217;s never too early to brush up those presentations and get them submitted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next big thing is that there are some changes coming to the WordPress mobile app. A lot of the Jetpack functionality will be removed from it, so this is going to have a little bit of an effect on daily users of the app, but it will also have an effect on regular contributors. I&#8217;ll have a link to the full write up in the show notes so that you don&#8217;t have to guess or hold it all in your memory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, this excellent design that you see on wordpress.org/news is finally making its way out to the next parts of the wordpress.org website. Before you know, it, there will be a fresh looking homepage as well as few other pages and then… to infinity and beyond (or something like that).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And next up I&#8217;ll be taking just a mid-year break from the podcast. And so the next time that I actually see you again, will be in September.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13198\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"People of WordPress: Carla Doria\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/07/people-of-wordpress-carla-doria/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 31 Jul 2022 19:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:6:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Features\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Interviews\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"HeroPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"People of WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13201\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:324:\"In this series, we share some of the inspiring stories of how WordPress and its global network of contributors can change people’s lives for the better.

This month we feature Carla Doria, a customer support specialist from South America on how WordPress opened up a new world for her, and gave her the ability to help the local community</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Carla, working with WordPress is a vital part of her life. It gave her a career and a community, in which she she would organize the first WordCamp in her city, Cochabamba, and the first in Bolivia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla studied industrial engineering and has a master’s degree in environmental studies.<br>Her first experience with WordPress was when she decided to start a small business designing and selling cushions and bedclothes.&nbsp;While Carla sat in the small store she had rented, hoping that people stopping at the shop windows would step in to buy something, she decided she needed to create a website.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>First steps with WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla had no budget to hire somebody, but she felt confident&nbsp; she could learn things on her own.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“Learning to use WordPress requires no code skills or a technical background. It needs an adventurous and playful spirit.” </p><cite>Carla Doria</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>She had always been studious, and decided she would figure out how to build a website herself. Carla ended up building a simple blog with WordPress. At the time, she didn’t even have a budget to buy a custom domain, so she used a free subdomain.<br><br>“Learning to use WordPress is easy. It requires no code skills or a technical background at all. It only needs an adventurous and playful spirit,” said Carla</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were no profits, and any income mainly went to pay the store’s rent. At the time, her previous company contacted her for a job opening that matched her profile. Carla needed that income and decided to closed the store and forget about being an entrepreneur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in employee mode, Carla started her new job as a technical writer for a software development company. Since Carla had completed her master’s degree in the UK, she was proficient in English. Her close affinity for computers and technology made it easy for her to translate complex software jargon into simple tutorial steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Carla got more interested in technical writing and started to improve her writing skills. This reconnected her with her previous enthusiasm for writing, and she decided to channel that interest into a blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Diving deep</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating her blog helped her become more familiar with WordPress and building websites. In 2015, Carla blogged about writing, her thoughts, book reviews, and everything that came to mind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through looking for answers to specific issues using her WordPress blog, Carla found the support forums a useful place to go. Soon she realized that she could also help answer other people’s questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-2.jpg?resize=600%2C900&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13189\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-2.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-2.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla began checking the forums as a hobby. She liked that she was able to help people and learn more while doing so. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of surfing social media during her work breaks, Carla focused on checking the WordPress forums. Through this she learnt about a support job in one of the global firms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She felt the job was made for her and was excited to support people in building their websites with WordPress. The role offered the possibility to work remotely and travel while still working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After three years as a technical writer, her career felt stuck. She was certain she did not want to return to any job related to industrial engineering. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla did not get through the selection process the first time. But after nearly 18 months between three applications and learning HTML and CSS, Carla finally secured a support job in 2016. With this job, WordPress became her main source of income.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Leading a local WordPress community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the job, Carla learned about the WordPress communities around the world and WordCamps. But when somebody asked about the WordPress community where Carla lived, she didn’t know what to say. Was there a community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She discovered no local group existed, so she researched what was needed to setup a meetup. Carla discussed the idea with others, but hesitated as she thought it would require an expert WordPress developer to organize.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But after trying to gauge interest, Carla realized that the only way to find community members was to start a community. In 2017, the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Cochabamba-WordPress-Meetup/\">WordPress community in Cochabamba</a> was born.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"684\" height=\"391\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/Comunidad_WP_Cochabamba_FSE_event2022.jpg?resize=684%2C391&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"The theme preview screen in the WordPress Cochabamba meeting on creating your website with blocks.\" class=\"wp-image-13236\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/Comunidad_WP_Cochabamba_FSE_event2022.jpg?w=684&amp;ssl=1 684w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/Comunidad_WP_Cochabamba_FSE_event2022.jpg?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>WordPress meeting in Cochabamba explored creating your website with blocks</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The group has had ups and downs, probably similar to any other community. Although Cochabamba is not a big city, they had issues finding a location that was free and available to anyone who wanted to join. People came with different levels of knowledge, from people with&nbsp;vast experience with WordPress to people with no experience but who wanted to learn.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community grew during the pandemic, as meetups went online and people from other cities in Bolivia were able to attend. After restrictions were lifted, there was a lot of excitement amongst members to meet each other in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Giving back through speaking</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-1.jpg?resize=600%2C900&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Carla reading a book under a tree\" class=\"wp-image-13191\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-1.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The community also helped Carla to develop a new skill in public speaking. She applied to be a speaker at WordCamp Mexico <a href=\"https://mexicocity.wordcamp.org/2019/\">2019</a> and <a href=\"https://mexicocity.wordcamp.org/2020/\">2020</a>, <a href=\"https://guayaquil.wordcamp.org/2019/\">WordCamp Guayaquil 2019</a>, and <a href=\"https://colombia.wordcamp.org/2020/\">WordCamp Colombia in 2020</a>. Her confidence grew while she enjoyed connecting with other communities and meeting people who were on similar pathways. Not all of them were developers, as she had presumed. Many, like her, started out as bloggers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"977\" height=\"419\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?resize=977%2C419&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"WordCamp Cochabamba\'s logo with blue and grey lettering and a hat\" class=\"wp-image-13228\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?w=977&amp;ssl=1 977w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?resize=300%2C129&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?resize=768%2C329&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, after three years, Carla applied to organize her first WordCamp in 2021 in <a href=\"https://cochabamba.wordcamp.org/2021/\">Cochabamba</a>. She had never imagined organizing any WordCamp, and through this having the experience to talk to sponsors and contact companies, and lead a group of people with different talents and backgrounds. Carla felt she had learnt so much from the experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to WordPress, Carla found a job she enjoyed, was able to work remotely, and help build something in her community to help people learn skills and find career opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla feels grateful for all she has been able to do thanks to WordPress. She said: “WordPress has led me to find good jobs.

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is an open source software project and, like many other open source software projects, has an entire community of people who show up to help improve it however they can. Most of you probably use WordPress every day in some way. And I&#8217;m going to assume that since you listen to this podcast, you&#8217;re also interested in how this all works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I mention practically every episode is that WordPress works and continues to work because of generous contributions from people all around the world. I consider my work with WordPress to be my way of giving back for everything that this software enabled me and my family to do. But I once was a first-time contributor, and I remember what it felt like before I knew everything.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I felt like it moved at the speed of light and that I could never tell what to do now, let alone what to do next. And that everyone around me basically already knew everything. And if you are feeling that way right now, I encourage you to take a big deep breath [breathe] and let me help you get started.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:43]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a roadmap sort of person. So I&#8217;m going to start by sharing the stages I&#8217;ve observed for folks who are contributing to open source. That way, you can tell where you are right now, which spoiler alert is probably a bit further along than you realize. Then I&#8217;ll give you some questions you can ask yourself for each stage to figure out what is a good fit for you. Think of it as a guided exploration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, the five stages. So these are they:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Connecting</strong>. That&#8217;s when you&#8217;re first learning about the community. You know WordPress exists, but now you&#8217;ve just discovered that the community exists. That&#8217;s where you are.&nbsp;</li><li>The second phase is <strong>Understanding</strong>. It&#8217;s when you are researching the community, like, you know it exists, you think you want to give back, and so you&#8217;re trying to figure out where everything is.&nbsp;</li><li>The third phase is what I call <strong>Engaging</strong>. It&#8217;s when you&#8217;re first interacting, you&#8217;ve downloaded the CMS, you have figured out which team you think you&#8217;re interested in, and you&#8217;re headed to events or meetings or whatever.&nbsp;</li><li>The fourth stage is one that I refer to as <strong>Performing</strong>. And that&#8217;s when you&#8217;ve decided that you&#8217;re gonna volunteer and you&#8217;re gonna take some action. You&#8217;re going to like a contributor day or running a release or whatever. I think that&#8217;s probably not the first place you land, running a release is probably a lot, but, you know, coordinating work on the release or something like that.&nbsp;</li><li>And then phase five, which is the <strong>Leading</strong> phase. That&#8217;s when you&#8217;re taking responsibility for things getting done.&nbsp;</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:08]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get any further, there are four important things to remember about those stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing to remember is that there is no set time between any of those stages. You can start in one and then three years later go to the next one, or you can start in one and go into the next stage tomorrow. The next thing to know is that each stage builds on the one before it. In my observation, anytime I have seen a contributor who feels like they&#8217;re really struggling, it&#8217;s because they skipped a stage in there, which really causes some trouble for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing to remember is that not everyone will make it through these stages, which is okay. The majority of the community stops at three. Most contributors stop at four. And that is perfectly fine. That is expected. That is normal and completely in line with what we expect from contribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, and the final thing to remember about that list of the phases is that very few people make it into that leadership stage. If we assume, like I do, that 1% of the people who are using WordPress also show up and contribute back to WordPress, then it&#8217;s kind of safe to assume also that about 1% of those people who have shown up to contribute to WordPress are moving into a space where they feel like they&#8217;re willing to take responsibility for making sure things get done in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:31]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like we all collectively feel responsible for WordPress&#8217;s success, but in that leadership area, you&#8217;re kind of taking responsibility for 40% of the web or whatever&#8217;s going on there. And not a lot of people make it there, and that is completely fine, too. So that&#8217;s our basic terminology today. Those are the caveats that go with our basic terminology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most difficulties that arise for new contributors happen because a stage got skipped somewhere along the way. It&#8217;s almost never intentional, but from what I&#8217;ve observed, that&#8217;s what makes it really difficult to get started and what makes it difficult to keep going once you&#8217;ve kind of already gotten in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, all right. Big breath, folks with me again [breathe]. Alright, it&#8217;s guided exploration time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First phase, the connecting phase. Remember, this is where you&#8217;ve just learned the community exists, people are talking about it, you don&#8217;t know much more. The first step for you is asking yourself what it is you could do. Or if there&#8217;s a project out there that looks particularly interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:36]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can ask yourself questions, like, am I a writer? And if I am a writer, do I write technical or prose. The other thing you can ask is, am I a PHP developer, a JavaScript developer, Python, Go; which language am I writing in because I find it most beautiful. Another thing you can ask yourself is, am I a teacher or a mentor, or do I just generally like to be a mighty helper? And I like to make sure that things keep running.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So once you&#8217;ve asked yourself those things, it&#8217;s on to phase two, the understanding phase. This is when you&#8217;re looking around at this new-to-you community to see what is happening where. So you take a look at the teams that are around, you think about whatever it was you said you were good at in the last question and you look at which teams might be a good fit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you said that you&#8217;re a good technical writer, then Docs probably is for you. Have you been training others to use WordPress for years? Then you might wanna look into Training. There are a lot of other things, obviously, like if you think you&#8217;re good at working with code PHP or JavaScript, you&#8217;re probably gonna end up in Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are particularly good at any of the other tech stacks that we have around in our Trac area or an Openverse, then that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll land over there. You have design options. Like if design is really your thing, we have a Design team, but we also have a Themes team. There are plenty of places that you can land depending on what it is that you feel like you are the best at and could really help the WordPress project. And so that&#8217;s your phase two.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you have gotten a good guess at a team, we&#8217;re gonna swing through to phase three, which is the engaging phase. This is the phase that is the scariest for most people, but it&#8217;s okay. I am here for you. I am here for you in this podcast. So you have figured out what you want to do in order to contribute, and you&#8217;ve got a sense for the team that looks right. There are two things that you do next.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:34]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One is that you can go to a meeting. There are many kinds of meetings. There are team meetings, bug scrubs, and testing sessions, but they&#8217;re all in Slack, which means that you can attend one from anywhere. When they kick off, you wave, you introduce yourself, you let everybody know that you&#8217;re there and you&#8217;re observing. Folks will welcome you and just kind of give you some concept of what they&#8217;re working on. Easy as that. You&#8217;ve done your first time meeting attendance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another good option is to keep an eye out for specific events. Some of those events happen online, like Global Translation Day. But also some of them happen in person like, Meetups or WordCamps. And there again, you show up, you wave, you introduce yourself, see if you can make a connection or two, let people know that you&#8217;re new and you&#8217;re just trying to figure out where you are and what you wanna do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve made it now, all the way to phase four, the performing phase, then give yourself a little pat on the back! Figuring out where you want to go and who your friendly faces are is the biggest challenge when you get started. So congratulations!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:37]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phase four is the phase where you&#8217;ve decided you&#8217;re brave enough to volunteer &#8211; to do some contribution. You&#8217;re volunteering your time. That&#8217;s where you are now. So oddly enough, you start this phase by assigning yourself something, assigning yourself, a task. This seems counterintuitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s this feeling that you can&#8217;t say that you&#8217;re gonna do something. That you can&#8217;t just assign something to yourself and say that you&#8217;re gonna do it. But in open source projects, you always can. You find a task where you&#8217;re comfortable, and you just mention that you would like to give it a try while the team is having their weekly meeting. And it&#8217;s simple as that. And not big things either. Like organizing an event or maintaining a component, those are probably too big for your first time around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m talking things like, &#8216;I will test that patch that you mentioned in the meeting.&#8217; Or &#8216;I will review the docs and make sure that they&#8217;re up to date with the most recent release.&#8217; Or &#8216;I can help run meetings for the next release.&#8217;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you have phase five, where you just repeat phase four until you are leading something! And I don&#8217;t mean leading in the 1950s sort of way, where you have like a corner office and you&#8217;re ordering people around. I mean, in the warm, inviting millennial way where you&#8217;re leading by inspiring people to do something or you&#8217;re leading because you make sure that the meeting happens every single week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you&#8217;re leading because you added screenshots to tickets that needed testing and so you moved something forward in a way that was helpful. Easy peasy. You can go to your first contributor today or a WordPress Slack meeting and just be a contributor by the time you leave, right? You might feel like ‘easy as that isn&#8217;t quite the right set of words right there. And as a matter of fact, you might be thinking to yourself, this woman is just plain wrong. It could not possibly be that easy. And I agree. It really isn&#8217;t literally quote-unquote just that easy. Just like handing someone a notebook and a pen will not instantly make them an award-winning novelist, handing someone a wordpress.org profile and credentials to Slack won&#8217;t instantly make them a contributor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For both of those examples, what makes someone good is the ability to try and fail and still be encouraged to try again. So if it&#8217;s been a while since you contributed and you&#8217;re thinking about returning, or if you&#8217;ve been listening to me for a while and you&#8217;re ready to give this contribution thing a try, I hope this helps you to feel brave enough to try and brave enough to fail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I encourage you to be brave enough to try again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:20]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at our small list of big things. My friends, we have a Performance team. This team has been a working group for a long time and is focused on some deep, inner workings of WordPress and its surrounding ecosystem to make sure that we are as fast and slick as possible. You can check them out on make.wordpress.org/performance, their brand new site, and see when they&#8217;re meeting, what they&#8217;re aiming to get into the WordPress 6.1 release, and if that&#8217;s something that you would like to contribute to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that there&#8217;s a brand new call out for testing. This time it&#8217;s focused on templates and retroactively applying them to an entire category of posts. So it&#8217;s a little bit workflow testing, a little bit technology testing, and we could really use your help in bug hunting for both of those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing is that you know since contribution is obviously the focus of today&#8217;s podcast, we are looking for table leads for WordCamp US’ contributor day that&#8217;s coming up in September. There&#8217;s a whole blog post about it, I&#8217;ll link to it in the show notes so that you&#8217;ll have all the info and can raise your hand if you want.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:12:25]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of things that I&#8217;ll have in the show notes, I also am going to put like a contributor quizlet guide thing. If the guided, figuring out of the teams in the phase two section, if that didn&#8217;t make any sense to you and you just need something to direct you specifically to potential teams, I&#8217;m gonna link to the contributor kind of sorting hat quiz that came out with WordCamp Europe.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I&#8217;m talking about Five for the Future– again. Before we get stuck right into the heart of it, 10 episodes ago, in episode 25, I focused on the Five for the Future initiative and I recommend that you listen to that before you join me in today&#8217;s episode. It&#8217;s only eight minutes and it gives you a history of the Five for the Future initiative, as well as some information on the Five for the Future program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It then goes on to talk about some of the original intentions behind that original initiative. The reason I bring this back up today is partially because one, I will talk about both the program and the initiative it&#8217;s based on literally anytime. I believe strongly that they are both a vital part of what will result in a triumph of the commons of WordPress, and keep this empowering project around for years to come.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also bring it up today because there&#8217;s conversation about a post I published a couple of months back that has generated some dialogue around the intentions of this catchy call to contribution. So to make sure that as we move through this discussion together, we are working with as much factual information as possible, I present to you some facts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First and foremost, the pillars of this initiative. The 5% in Five for the Future is aspirational. Contribution to open source is a question and indication of privilege. So the 5% is not a requirement, but rather it&#8217;s an aim. It could refer to 5% of your time or 5% of your resources, or just any amount of your time or resources around. Regardless of how you&#8217;re defining it, it is an aspiration, not a requirement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second pillar, pledges show your intention and whatever contributions you are able to offer after you&#8217;ve made your pledge are always welcome. No one is out there checking for 100% completion of the hours that you intended to give back to WordPress versus the hours that you actually succeeded at giving back to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many volunteers that make sure that this project is running and functional and has plenty of people knowing how to get things done and how to teach others how to get things done. It&#8217;s all coming from generosity of heart.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:52]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of generosity, the third thing that is important about this initiative is that it insists on and wants to celebrate a culture of generosity. Beyond the concept of a pledge, is the idea of generous collaboration toward the long term health and stability of our project for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As contributors, we understand that we are greater than the sum of our parts and what we build <em>within</em> WordPress empowers those who build <em>with</em> WordPress. So those are the pillars that went into that initial thought, that opening Five for the Future call to action that Matt gave to everybody in 2014.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so now I want to share with you some of the pillars of the program that has grown up around it. So the Five for the Future initiative, if you&#8217;re not familiar, was started in 2014 and is a grand call to all of us to remember to give back to the shared commons of WordPress. Its aim was to help guard against what is called the “tragedy of the commons,” where resources are continually taken out and not necessarily reinvested in. No one&#8217;s necessarily putting anything back into those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:06]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the starting point for all of this. So the program, the Five for the Future program, in 2018 was built as a collaborative effort with full participation and buy-in from the contributors who were active in the project at the time. It allowed anyone to raise their hands, to show support of WordPress via a pledge and also started a multi-year discussion of how to define contributions in a way that let us automatically provide props and therefore more effectively put badges on people&#8217;s wordpress.org profiles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then in 2019, there was an additional pilot of the program, which kind of offered some team structure, which was intended to not only take on work that I don&#8217;t like to ask volunteers to do, but also to provide some checks and balances to an absolute raft of sponsored contributor hours that we had started to see show up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us then to the post that I mentioned at the start. Knowledgeable supporters of the WordPress open source project have debated next iterations to Five for the Future activity and programming. So, to bring the conversation to a central set of questions, or rather to bring the conversation to a central spot, I raised these two questions. One, what activities can we see inside our contributor networks? So wordpress.org, make.wordpress.org, the Rosetta sites that we have, Slack, et cetera.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:30]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what activities can we see inside the contributor networks that we can flag to enable easier distribution of props and therefore badges? The second question is, what activities can we see also in those contributor networks that appear to be contributions, but in the end are only benefiting the person or company that provides the contributions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it&#8217;s worth that discussion then also raised a third question that I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve even started to tackle, which is what about the activities that are not in the contributor network, but still do move WordPress forward? Cause there are so, so many of those things and it&#8217;s a great question. I don&#8217;t have an answer and just so that I don&#8217;t leave you all with a series of questions for which there are no answers provided in this particular podcast, I do have a few answers for questions that I have seen floating around this discussion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first question is actually a bunch of questions. There are like three parts to it. What are props, who gives props, and who tracks them? So ‘props’ is a term used in WordPress to describe shared recognition of a contribution. Think of it as like a hat tip or kudos or an assist. However you think about it, it&#8217;s recognition of the other people who helped to solve a problem along the way. That is what props are.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:47]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second part of that question is who gives props and historically developers have given props, which tends to mean that it&#8217;s mostly developers who get props. But now, also, any team rep during a release cycle can provide props to folks on their team, volunteers on their team who were really helpful during the course of the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And recently we also added the functionality for ad hoc props to be given in the Slack props channel, and those get added to your profile activity. So that someone can give you basically a public thanks for having helped on something that they were working on. And then that gets logged in your activity tracker on your WordPress.org profile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final question in that first big question is who tracks these props? And the answer is human beings! Which is why folks feel like they have to do a ton of things before they even get props. And that&#8217;s also why I&#8217;d like to automate more and more of them so that you don&#8217;t have to do a ton of things in order for someone to show up and acknowledge that you are part of a solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:51]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the second question that I&#8217;ve seen kind of running around is, where do props start? And that is a great question that has been asked year after year. And one that I think we should continue to ask. The reality is that we won&#8217;t be able to see every contribution to WordPress, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they aren&#8217;t valuable. And it doesn&#8217;t mean that they don&#8217;t matter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building our culture of generosity helps us to better recognize and celebrate each other for all of our contributions, whether they are for a major release or a major event, or one of these new ad hoc props that you can offer to people. And if we see more and more of the same type of contributions being celebrated, then we can also work toward automating those as well, so that you don&#8217;t have to do a super ton of them before someone has noticed that you&#8217;ve done even one of them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third big question that has been running around is, what about the people who don&#8217;t want the props? If people want to be literally anonymous, then deletion requests are probably your way to go. But I actually don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the question here. I think the question is what if a prop holds no intrinsic value to you and then, you know, I wanna thank you for that spirit of generosity. And I also wanna say that I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:02]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully, all of these answers clarify what lies at the heart of what is intended with the Five for the Future initiative and the program that&#8217;s built on top of it. And why I care so much about fixing the ways we offer props to folks. For me, it&#8217;s not about assessing the worthiness of people or companies or any of their contributions. For me, it&#8217;s about reinvesting in the shared commons of the WordPress ecosystem, by finding a way that our economy can entice folks to put back into WordPress, something close to the benefit that they receive from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. Thank you all for making it into the final stretches with me. These three things that I&#8217;m sharing also have companion blog posts to go with them because they are very big questions or very big features, very big plugin kind of things that we&#8217;re looking at. And so you&#8217;ll be able to find those in the show notes, or you can go to wordpress.org/news if you&#8217;re listening to this in a podcast player of your choice that is not wordpress.org.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:10]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first one on my list is a new plugin. It is called Create Block Theme. And it&#8217;s gonna make it easier for theme builders to use the existing site editor tools to create new block themes. I&#8217;m very excited about this. Uh, you can find it on make.wordpress.org/themes. And I will also include a link to it in the show notes below.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If themes are not your area of expertise, but you are interested in documentation or the DevHub or to an extent design things, then the improvements that are being worked on for the DevHub are definitely in your area. That&#8217;s kind of a Meta task, but has a few other pieces involved as well. That can be found on make.wordpress.org/meta. But again, I will have a link to the very, very detailed blog post in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s got a bunch of hypothetical changes that are being suggested for the WordPress developer docs, uh, especially when it comes to the function reference. And so there are gonna be some slight design questions, but not like, graphic design/visual design, more in the like, can humans read this design area of things? And so that will be a good one to look at. If you are sort of in the Meta or Documentation vein of things in the way that you like to contribute to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:011:30]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final thing is about open sourcing theme designs. So open sourcing everything obviously is important to us. And the design tool that we use, this tool called Figma, is open to the public. And so it&#8217;s possible for folks to be able to kind of get in there and use and reuse any design elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there&#8217;s a discussion happening over on make.wordpress.org/design about how that can and should look in the future. And so if design is definitely your area, and again, this kind of lines up with themes a little bit, then wander over into that one, for which there will also be a link in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13132\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"The Month in WordPress – June 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/07/the-month-in-wordpress-june-2022/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 06 Jul 2022 14:19:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"month in wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13069\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:313:\"With WordPress 6.1 already in the works, a lot of updates happened during June.

The potential and power of blogs would be an influence in the rest of his life.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/leo-gopal.jpeg?fit=720%2C960&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Leo sat in front of a pond. \" class=\"wp-image-13027\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/leo-gopal.jpeg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/leo-gopal.jpeg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As Leo&#8217;s confidence grew through expressing himself in writing, he was determined that his stutter would &#8216;no longer hold power over him&#8217;. In 2005, with the encouragement of his blog readers, he spent his school summer break in his room working on reducing his stutter. WordPress would be the tool that would enable him to connect with his blog readers and to express his creativity and thoughts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Making WordPress your own</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In high school, Leo had opted for programming as one of his subjects. In 2008, he built his first website using WordPress for the students at the school. This was the first time he saw the real value of WordPress and open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the following years, he increasingly spent time searching online for information on &#8216;Customising WordPress&#8217; and &#8216;Making WordPress your own&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo wanted to keep busy and as soon as he finished school, he applied for every entry-level web-related job that he could find. He was hired by a company for the role of webmaster for its Marketing team focused on WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He continued to grow his skills as a WordPress developer with the help of useful documentation that he could find and through his helpful local WordPress Community. This helped him earn a living and support his family.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Helping yourself through helping others in the community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, Leo moved full-time to Cape Town, South Africa, and started as a developer at a web development agency, eventually progressing to its Head of Development and managing a small team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He chose WordPress as his main platform for development mainly because of the community behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“<em>Had it not been for those searches on how to make WordPress your own, my life would have turned out a lot differently</em>.”&nbsp;</p><cite>Leo Gopal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo felt he had a hurdle to overcome working in web sector. He didn’t feel like a ‘real developer’ being self-taught. However, through the community, he realized that there were many self-taught developers and he was not alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside his development path, Leo faced a mental health journey. He had suffered from depression and found the community to be accepting and understanding of this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At WordCamp Cape Town 2016, he stood in front of an audience and gave a talk: “<a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2016/11/24/leo-gopal-the-wordpress-community-mental-wellness-and-you/\">The WordPress Community, Mental Wellness, and You</a>”. Following this talk, he was greeted by many attendees who thanked him for talking so openly about mental health issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Leo speaking at the podium at WordCamp Cape Town in 2016\" class=\"wp-image-13023\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Leo speaking at a WordCamp</em> Cape Town, 2016</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo has been diagnosed with bipolar, previously known as manic depression. In 2017, he hit a low period and struggled to keep going. He found support and understanding in the community in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has openly written about his experiences with depression and started an initiative where topics of mental health and general wellbeing can be freely and non-judgmentally discussed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said that by helping others, he is helping himself, every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributing to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo has contributed to the community as a Co-organizer in South Africa for the 2016 and 2017 WordCamp Cape Town, WordPress Meetup Cape Town 2015 &#8211; 2016, and WordPress Durban 2017 – 2020. He has also spoken at a number of WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintaining connections with people he had met through these events Leo felt was a great aid to his mental wellbeing during the Covid pandemic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has contributed to core and plugins and believes that WordPress and its community make it extremely easy to contribute. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“<em>The cost to start contributing is extremely low &#8211; start now</em>”.</p><cite>Leo Gopal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>When the ability to create and add patterns to the WordPress.org library came out in 2021, Leo used it almost immediately and created a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/pattern/call-to-action-section-2/\">call-to-action box</a> which could be used by both his clients and the community. He plans to release a few more complex patterns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Yes, we can.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo’s mantra is “I can do it!”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Leo speaking at a WordCamp Cape Town in 2019\" class=\"wp-image-13032\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?w=1944&amp;ssl=1 1944w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Leo speaking at a WordCamp</em> Cape Town, 2019</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting over a stutter, overcoming poverty, being urgently self-taught, growing up in a country with “load shedding” electricity outages, and one of the slowest rated internet speeds in the developing world, and strengthening mental wellness are not easy feats., And yet, he knows he can do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“<em>Never, ever think you do not have the &#8216;right&#8217; circumstances for success.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right my friends. So it&#8217;s been about a month since WordPress 6.0 came out and you know what that means. It means we are already looking at the next major WordPress release because,&nbsp; as most of you know, WordPress never sleeps. Y&#8217;all are honestly up and hustling like 24/7 as far as I can tell, which is great! And is one of the many benefits of being a global community, I suppose.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:05]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But anyway, back to this major release. There was a high-level roadmap shared by Mattias Ventura at the start of June. And it lists some focus areas for the Block Editor, continued refinements to the template editor and navigation block, and some work on global styles and more / better blocks and design tools that are slated to ship with WordPress 6.1. From the WordPress core side, though, there are a couple hundred tickets that are milestoned for the next major.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being milestoned for a release means that either a ticket wasn&#8217;t ready for the last release and was moved to the next available one, or a ticket has become ready for a release since the last major release occurred. That list as it stands might be a little bit too big for a single release. However, honestly, no list is too big if we have enough folks contributing.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you&#8217;ve never contributed to a major release of WordPress before, and you&#8217;re interested to know how that works, there are some things to keep an eye out for over the next few weeks. We are in what is considered the planning phase for the next big release. And so there are two or three things you&#8217;re gonna see pretty soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:11]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First is a planning kickoff post. That post gets published on make.wordpress.org/core, and it includes notes on volunteering for the release squad, some guesses at areas of focus based on the tickets that we&#8217;re seeing in track, a schedule, the whole kit, and caboodle. It&#8217;s all in there. If you are wanting to know how to lend a hand and how to take your first steps to core contribution, apart from the new contributor meeting that happens before the dev chat, that post is the place to start.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So keep an eye out on make.wordpress.org/core for that. And then the second thing that shows up in the planning phase for any major release is bug scrub and ticket triage meetings. Like I mentioned, there are the new contributor meetings where they scrub tickets and talk through the basics of what we&#8217;re seeing on good first bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I mentioned that here often, I just mentioned it in the last, in the last bullet point, but there are also regular bug scrubs and ticket triaging sessions where a kind contributor chooses a set of tickets to review and then leads other contributors through the process of checking to see if a ticket is valid to see if it can be replicated to see if it has a patch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:03:23]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there are decisions that are blocking it and how to move those decisions forward, and generally just kind of discuss what else has to be done in order to take the ticket to the next step. Those get announced in the dev chat every Wednesday, but also there is a post that will go up on make.wordpress.org/core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wish I had a faster way to say that instead of just racing through the whole URL every time. But it&#8217;ll be okay. We&#8217;ll put it in the show notes in case you would rather just click some stuff. And the third thing to keep an eye out for. If development is not your thing, so writing code is not already part of your tool belt, that&#8217;s totally fine. There are many other important areas where you can contribute, too. Design, training, support, polyglots, marketing, documentation, and more. These teams all do work in and around a release that is vital to WordPress&#8217; overall success.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:04:19]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a final thought of all. If that felt a little too intense if you want to see where this ship is headed, but you can&#8217;t quite commit to grabbing an oar today, that&#8217;s fine, too. The most important thing is that if you are a member of the community, as an extender or a user or a die-hard contributor, or a new contributor, the most important thing is that you have some general awareness of what the overall direction is.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might do that by experimenting with blocks in your products or by testing screen readers against your workflow or even by setting aside an hour to participate in the latest testing prompt. Being aware of what&#8217;s happening in and around your area of the project will help to keep you kind of prepared and knowledgeable to lend a hand whenever it is that you are ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:05:14]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that then brings us to our small list of big things. My friends, registration is now open for the WordPress Speaker Workshop for Women Voices in India. That&#8217;s taking place on September 24th and 25th. Uh, it&#8217;s happening over Zoom, so location or travel shouldn&#8217;t really be an obstacle for you. I&#8217;m going to leave a link to some information about that in the show notes. It should be an excellent opportunity that [the] WP Diversity initiative that WordPress has, that the community team helps to foster, is really an excellent experience. And so I hope that you register and attend that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the second thing actually is a bit of a celebration. The Photo Directory recently hit a huge milestone of 3000 photos! And you also can submit your photos to wordpress.org/photos. If you feel so inclined to make a contribution of that type.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:06:07]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing on my smallest of big things is actually kind of a, a WordPress tooltip a little bit of a WordPress project did-ya-know? So, there is a special channel in WordPress Slack for sharing thanks to folks who were especially helpful to you. It&#8217;s called the Props Channel. And when someone shares props with you, it even shows up in your activity on your wordpress.org profile. Pretty cool, huh? Props to the Meta team for that one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13013\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"WP Briefing: Episode 33: Some Important Questions from WCEU\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/06/episode-33-some-important-questions-from-wceu/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 11:01:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"wp-briefing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=13005\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:165:\"WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden Chomphosy covers some important questions from WordCamp Europe on this special episode of the WordPress Briefing podcast. \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:9:\"enclosure\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:3:\"url\";s:60:\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/WP-Briefing-033.mp3\";s:6:\"length\";s:1:\"0\";s:4:\"type\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Santana Inniss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13788:\"\n<p>In the thirty-third episode of the WordPress Briefing, hear Josepha Haden Chomphosy recap important questions from WordCamp Europe, and a selection of Contributor Day interviews. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Have a question you&#8217;d like answered?

It&#8217;s a big part of our business. And I think it&#8217;s like WordPress is a big part of all the hosting company, company’s, businesses, you know? So for us, it is like, we want to make it better. We want to give back. We want to understand, you know, where we can contribute the most. And we see it as a, you know, win, win, win situation for everyone, for clients, for the whole ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for us as a business, of course!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Milana Cap </strong>00:00:32]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite WordPress component is WP CLI. That&#8217;s my crush, haha, because I love terminal. I love doing it. I&#8217;m not a really UI type of person, I get lost in UI. But in terminal, you just type command and it does what you want. And a WP CLI is much more powerful than WordPress dashboard. You can do so many things there and you can have fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, so that&#8217;s my go-to tool!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:10]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello everyone. And welcome to the WordPress Briefing– the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:36]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many, many people were at WordCamp Europe a couple of weeks ago. And at the end, Matt and I closed out the event sessions with a little question and answer time from the community. I was excited to see everyone and excited to answer their questions. But as with all spur of the moment answers, I experienced this <em>l&#8217;esprit de l&#8217;escalier </em>and I found that there were a few things that I would have answered a little more completely if I had taken more than two seconds to think about them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So today I&#8217;m going to augment some of the answers from that session with a little more context and clarity. There was a question from Laura Byrne about favorite blocks in recent WordPress releases. And given that I was exclusively holding WordCamp Europe information in my brain at the time, I couldn&#8217;t think of which block was my favorite. While I was sitting there on that stage,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I realized that one of my favorite things about WordPress’s 6.0 release, like Matt, wasn&#8217;t really a block, but it was a functional workflow sort of thing. So my favorite thing was the ability to lock blocks, but I mean, the question was about favorite blocks. And so I do know that some of the most anticipated blocks are the Flexbox layout blocks. Whew. What a sentence!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:46]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try to say that three times fast! Those blocks are the Flexbox layout blocks, they are sort of shortcuts that show up when you&#8217;re selecting multiple blocks and allow for easy side-by-side layouts. I&#8217;m not explaining it in a way that does it much justice, but I will share a link in the show notes that has more information and you can kind of see how empowering that particular block is in the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next question I wanted to give a little more context to came from Courtney Robertson. She asked about how to make translated content more readily available on learn.wordpress.org. My answer was pretty far ranging and talked about why it&#8217;s harder to commit to prioritizing that over, for my example, translating WordPress core.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also understand that there are people who want to help and just need someone to point them in the right direction. And so I want to be clear that it is possible to have workshops in any language on learn.wordpress.org right now. We just don&#8217;t have a lot of people contributing those translations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are conversations going on right now in the training team about using Glotpress on learn.wordpress.org, and also how to translate subtitles. So, if you are looking for ways to give back through translation and training is an important kind of area of your focus. I will have links to both of those things in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:04:11]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also gave a quick answer, uh, after this question about how hard it is to recognize contributions that are separate from a major event or major release. In this case, when I say recognize, that&#8217;s recognized as in thank, not recognize as in, know it exists. In case it&#8217;s not clear why that was connected, why that answer was connected to the question, training materials are self-serve and not always specific to individual releases of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that means the maintenance of any content around training happens routinely over the course of time, rather than because of a specific release or a WordCamp. What sometimes can make it a little harder to entice people to join us in that work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now the third question I&#8217;d like to tackle is the one that came from Megan Rose. She asked how we can encourage better diversity as we go back to in-person events. My answer was more about the big picture, program-wide work that has been done and specific awarenesses that I, as a leader, have been keeping top of mind. That answer is still true and is still important, but again, it doesn&#8217;t really help anyone who&#8217;s wondering how they can show up today in their own communities, and do the hard work of fostering an inclusive space there so that we can confidently welcome more diverse voices together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:05:27]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great place to start is to have conversations with people who aren&#8217;t like you and really listen. Also recognizing that we all come from different backgrounds that give us more or less opportunity and always be asking yourself, who is missing from this conversation and why, how can I find them and invite them into our own WordPress spaces?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that all kind of feels right up your alley, I would check out the show notes. I&#8217;ll have some links in there to the community team’s site, as well as a few posts that will help you to explore that a bit further as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were also a couple of questions about market share slash usage of WordPress, and Five for the Future that I really do want to answer, but as I was writing up the context and just kind of exploring the questions that people were raising, it turned out to really be quite a big set of answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I will do those in either two separate episodes of their own or one surprisingly long, for me, episode. And so there you have it, a lightning round, deep dive on a few questions from WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Jonathan Desrosiers </strong>00:06:41]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s definitely great to be back in person. Um, it&#8217;s been a long two years, two or three years for a lot of people and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s great that we&#8217;re such an asynchronous community and we can all stay connected online through Slack and different means. Um, but there are some things that you can&#8217;t replace, like making friends with people and learning people&#8217;s demeanors and having some discussions in person that you can&#8217;t replace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, uh, I&#8217;m really excited to see people I haven&#8217;t seen in a long time. Meet new people and, um, you know, have some of those discussions here today in Portugal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:07:21]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which then brings us to our small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you missed the announcement, WordCamp Europe will be in Athens next year. And the call for organizers is open already. It&#8217;s an experience that is absolutely irreplaceable. So I&#8217;ll link to that in the show notes, in case you&#8217;ve always wanted to give back to WordPress that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on my list is that work on the next major release of WordPress is already underway. There is a post with roadmap info that was published recently, as well as a slightly more casual thread on Twitter. I&#8217;ve linked both of those in the show notes, so that you have some concept of what it is that we are aiming for in 6.1, and also a concept of where to go to get started working on it if that&#8217;s what you feel like doing, uh, for the next three to four months– 120 days, roughly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, and finally. This is less of like a thing to be aware of in the next two weeks and kind of a little WordPress project tool tip. Did you know that we have a calendar that shows all meetings for all teams all week long? It will make you feel tired by the amount of work that gets done in the WordPress project every week, but it&#8217;s right there on make.wordpress.org/meetings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you never have to wonder where folks are meeting to talk about things ever again. And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Santana Inniss &amp; Héctor Prieto </strong>00:09:11]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello!

She recalls: “No one thought to say, ‘Dee, you look like you’re good at this, you should pursue it…’. I mean, I was a girl (and I was told girls didn’t ‘do’ computers). No one in the circles I moved in really had any idea where this technology revolution would take us.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With no particular career path into technology, Dee was encouraged in her final year of school to apply for a job in a bank where she worked and became a teller three years later. She gained financial independence, which enabled her to travel as a 20-year-old and spend the next three years exploring the US and Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, she noted how the world had changed: the first computer mouse she had seen had come out in 1983, and 20 years later WordPress was founded.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Journey into coding</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During those 20 years, Dee worked as a nanny, working in child care centers, in customer support, and as a temp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1999, she packed up her bags once again, and moved from New Zealand to Australia. She took a place at a performing arts school where she honed her singing and performance skills and volunteered her time to the music director who was starting to experiment with sending out HTML newsletters and updates via email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And so my personal revolution began. On the day after I graduated from that course, I walked into a full-time role as that music director’s assistant and began my journey back to code.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of that job, Dee edited and sent HTML newsletters on a weekly basis. This ignited her interest in programming, and she bought books about coding for the web and experimented on her home-built PC making web pages. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“I’m sure, like a lot of us, I remember the thrill of creating that first HTML file and seeing a ‘Hello World’ or similar heading rendered in the browser. From there, I was completely hooked.”</p>\n<cite>Dee Teal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Later she moved to the IT department and took on maintenance of all the websites. By 2004, she was working full-time as a webmaster. A year later, she was running a small business creating sites on the side. Four years after that, her business became her full-time job as she left employment to pursue her Masters Degree in Digital Communication and Culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Dee with other contributors getting things ready for a WordCamp\" class=\"wp-image-12961\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Dee and other volunteers setting up for a local WordCamp</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee found the theory and sociology behind the web, and its facilitation of human and machine communication fascinating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I love the fact that the tech industry involves a constant constant curve of growth and discovery, which results in a perpetual exercise in finding creative elegant solutions for sticky problems.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Dee, being able to use her innate curiosity to leverage processes, people, and tools, fuelled by a focus on communicating a message, has been a defining inspiration in her work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This combined fascination coincided with her meeting WordPress in 2009 and subsequently its community. She moved her existing blog to the software and it became the CMS of choice for all her client work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The WordPress community can change your world</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2011, she stumbled across WordCamps and by extension the WordPress community. Dee has reflected publicly that WordPress didn’t change her life, its community changed her world!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She flew on a whim from her then home in Sydney to attend a WordCamp in Melbourne she had found after a search for ‘WordPress Conferences’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I met welcoming people, made friends, connected, and came back home excited and hopeful about continuing this connection with the wider WordPress community.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a community locally around WordPress got off to a slow start in Sydney. From an inauspicious early WordPress Sydney meetup in the function room of a pub, her connection and involvement took off. Before long she was helping organize that meetup, and by the time she moved away from that great city it had branched into two meetups, and soon after, into three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was so inspired by the community that at the end of that first year and her second WordCamp, she raised her hand to help organize a WordCamp Sydney in 2012, and after moving interstate, WordCamp Melbourne in 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;WordPress and any other software package exist to serve people.&#8221;</p>\n<cite>Dee Teal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee said: “WordPress, software, technology, the Internet will come and go, morph, and change, evolve. Maybe WordPress will last forever, maybe it will morph into something else, maybe one day it will look completely different than it did when I first started (actually, that’s true now). The thing that doesn’t change is the humanity around it. WordPress and any other software package exist to serve people.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added: “The thing that I have learned, not only through WordPress but in life, is that if we too serve the people around what we’re doing, we ourselves will grow, develop and change alongside the people we serve, and the tools we use to serve them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"329\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=1024%2C329&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Dee pictured second from left as part of the WordPress 5.6 contributors\" class=\"wp-image-12957\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=1024%2C329&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=300%2C96&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=768%2C246&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Some of the contributors to the <em>WordPress 5.6 release</em> </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee was a coordinator for WordPress 5.6 release in 2020 and was able to encourage others to learn about the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Helping others and sharing knowledge through WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee has been an advocate for cross-cultural collaboration and understanding in both WordPress and her work for a large distributed agency which has people from more than 24 countries and operates across 16 timezones.

It’s those connections, it’s the friendships. It’s the network of work, referrals, support, help, encouragement that has kept me wired into this community and committed to helping other people find that connection and growth for themselves.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee’s career in WordPress has moved through coding, into project management of large scale WordPress projects, and now into delivery leadership. Her connections to community have helped &#8216;fuel the transitions&#8217; through these chapters of her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I believe that the place I’ve found and the opportunities I have had owe as much to my own desire and ambition as they do to the help, support and belief of the community around me; sometimes even more than I’ve felt in myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She feels that she is ‘living proof’ that by helping, connecting, and resourcing other people, you can be helped, resourced and connected into places you had never thought possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has enabled her to reach and have a career in technology that she did not know existed as a teenager playing with that first computer mouse and experimenting with code. Dee hopes her story will inspire others in their journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>), Meher Bala (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>meher</a>), Chloe Bringmann (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a>), Nalini Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>nalininonstopnewsuk</a>), and Larissa Murillo (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>lmurillom</a>) for work on this feature.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it. As well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the approach of various mid-year breaks and the prospect of wandering off for some safe, restorative travel, I&#8217;ve been updating my to-read and re-read list. As I was looking at the queued books for my Northern hemisphere summer, there were some common threads, mostly around leadership, but there&#8217;s also like a chunk that&#8217;s about cross-cultural group theory and economics, and then like some beach reads, but there&#8217;s one group in particular that you all might find interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s a group that&#8217;s sort of like a back-to-FOSS basics list. So I&#8217;ll share my top few with you in case you want to pack a copy for your next getaway.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one on our list is called Producing Open Source Software by Karl Fogel. I think everyone who contributes to FOSS projects has received this as one of their first recommendations. Like, y&#8217;all are building open software? Excellent, you need to read Producing Open Source Software. Like, that is just a sentence that comes out of everyone&#8217;s mouths. So this was one of the first open source books that was recommended to me when I joined the WordPress community. It was freshly revised in 2020, and I haven&#8217;t given it a read since then, which is why it is on my reread list this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it shaped the early days of the WordPress project’s leadership, and their lead developers, and some of WordPress&#8217;s basic philosophies. It&#8217;s all available online, under a creative commons, ShareAlike license. And so it&#8217;s worth the read. I&#8217;ll put a link to it in the show notes so it&#8217;s easy for everyone to find in the event that is your preferred beach read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one on this list is a book from Nadia Eghbal. She wrote the excellent Roads and Bridges report that also is probably not light beach reading, but you know, this one is on my list to read this summer because Eghbal always delivers truths about the reality of maintaining popular software, popular, open source software, in a way that&#8217;s easy for me to access and process rather than getting paralyzed by the enormity of it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it&#8217;s worth your mileage may vary on that. I realized that, like, I live and breathe open source stuff. And so just because I am not paralyzed by the enormity of her explanations of things doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that you will have a similar experience. And so I&#8217;m just going to claim that elephant in the room for all of us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you only read one book on this list this year, I think that this should be the one that you read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:14]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third one is called Code: Collaborative Ownership and the Digital Economy. It was edited by Rishab Aiyer Ghosh. I am certain that I butchered that name. And so I apologize on my own behalf to everyone that knows whether or not I said it correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This book focuses on intellectual property rights and the original purpose of having anything like copyright in the world. So, right up my alley! The writers who contributed to this work promise exploration of the plight of creativity in the commons, the role of sharing in creative advancement, and a concept of what it would look like if intellectual property were to mean the second closing of an ecosystem versus a triumph of the commons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, obviously, this one is very light reading. You can take this topic to high tea and everyone will not know what you&#8217;re talking about. However, this one looks like a really interesting book to me and I am just super ready to read it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:19]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second to last one on the list is a book called Humble Inquiry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a new-to-me book that seems right in line with one of my favorite books to recommend to leaders in the open source space. From reviews of it, I have gathered that it takes a hard look at the value of listening and asking for clarification in a world that puts a high value on an unsolicited hot take.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It puts the importance of high trust relationship building, which is at the heart of any cross-culturally aware organization. And for folks who&#8217;ve been working with me for a while, you know, that relationship building is an important part of my leadership expectations for myself. So it puts relationship building at the front and center with a promise of practical applications for everyday life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you ever have tried to tackle a complicated topic like this, you know that practical applications are really hard to come by and it&#8217;s often hard to understand it if you don&#8217;t have those practical applications. And so that is why this one is on my read and reread list this year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:24]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then finally the WordPress Milestones book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this sounds like a shameless plug for WordPress. And on the one hand, this whole podcast is about WordPress. And so, yes! But on the other hand, I actually am reading this for two specific reasons. I&#8217;m rereading this actually. I read it when I first joined Automattic. And so the first of the two reasons that I&#8217;m rereading it this year is that volume two of this is, like the second decade of WordPress currently, being researched and written in preparation for WordPress’s 20th birthday next year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I am rereading this to kind of get that all back in my mind as that work is getting done. And the second reason is that I honestly like to remind myself of how far we&#8217;ve come sometimes. I talk about our work frequently. And I talk about what we&#8217;re working on right now, all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I talk about what we&#8217;re looking at three years from now, five years from now. The biggest concerns of today, tomorrow, and the future-future. And it&#8217;s very easy to forget how much success WordPress has had and how much growth the contributors that support us have had over the course of our long and storied history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:40]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I like to go back to that just to kind of give myself some grounding in our progress, as well as get some concept for how we can move forward together. So that one is also available online. Also under a creative commons ShareAlike license and it is also worth the read. I will share a link to that with the other one in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. Let&#8217;s see what we got in the old lineup today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, firstly WordCamp Europe is happening this week and it&#8217;s possible to watch the live stream from the comfort of your own home. There are some smart and talented speakers at the event. So I encourage you to catch a few if you have the time. I&#8217;ll include a link to the live stream information in the show notes below, and then also you can always keep an eye out on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be a lot of discussions, a lot of conversation there. And so you can engage with folks that are there at the time and catch up on those conversations, catch up on those presentations in your own time, as it fits into your day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:50]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that WordPress’s community team is preparing the annual meetup survey right now. So if you participate in meetup events, keep an eye out for that because your feedback helps us to make plans to improve that program so that it works better for you. And it helps you to learn WordPress better and feel more confident with what you are taking out into the world that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, if you are wanting to use this as a chance to contribute, we actually will need folks who are able to translate the surveys as well. So I&#8217;ll leave a link to some information about that in the show notes. If all of that stuff about contribution didn&#8217;t make any sense, then just like keep an eye out from your meetup organizer and they will make sure that you have that survey so that you can have your voice heard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:33]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then item three is less of an item. I mean, it&#8217;s an item cause it&#8217;s in this list, but it&#8217;s less of, like, a thing to know and more of a general thing to be aware of. It&#8217;s a general awareness item. There&#8217;s a lot going on in WordPress right now. I can see how hard it is to keep track of some of these things these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know as someone who&#8217;s looking at this all day every day that, yeah, it&#8217;s a lot. And it&#8217;s hard to get your bearings. So if you have a team that you contribute to already, don&#8217;t forget to reach out to each other, just to check-in. Sometimes we don&#8217;t think to ask for help. Sometimes we don&#8217;t think to offer help and you know, if no one needs any help from you at that moment, a little hello also can brighten someone&#8217;s day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your smallest of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12940\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:26:\"WordPress 6.0 “Arturo”\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/05/arturo/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 24 May 2022 20:01:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"6.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12879\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:278:\"Say hello to “Arturo” and WordPress 6.0, inspired by Grammy-winning jazz musician, Arturo O’Farrill.

With thoughtful updates to the writing experience, building better block functionality, and adding a new intuitive style switcher, I’m really proud of the work that’s been done in this release to make a great site editing experience.</p><cite>Josepha Haden Chomphosy, Executive Director</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.0.zip\">Download WordPress 6.0</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s Inside</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Writing-Improvements-1.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Selecting multiple lines of text from two blocks\" class=\"wp-image-12887\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Writing-Improvements-1.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Writing-Improvements-1.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Writing-Improvements-1.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Writing-Improvements-1.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Enhanced Writing Experience</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing improvements abound, whether you’re writing a brand new post or adding elements to an existing page. Explore more ways to streamline your content creation process, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Select text across multiple blocks for easier copying and pasting.</li><li>Type two open brackets `<code>[[</code>` to quickly access a list of recent posts and pages.</li><li>Keep existing styles when you transform some blocks from one kind to another—from a Paragraph block to a Code block, for instance.</li><li>Create customized buttons and any new buttons you make will retain the style customizations automatically.</li><li>Make tag clouds and social icons even more appealing with updated settings and controls, and a new outline style for the tag cloud.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Style-switcher-big.gif?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Style variations of Twenty Twenty Two theme\" class=\"wp-image-12893\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Style Switching&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Block themes now include the option to contain multiple style variations. This expands the new Style system even further and enables shortcuts to switch the look and feel of your site all within a single theme. In block themes that support this feature, you can change both the available settings, like the font-weight, and the style options, like the default color palette. Change the look and feel of your site with just a few clicks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Popover listing available templates\" class=\"wp-image-12889\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>More Template Choices</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.0 includes five new template options for block themes: author, date, categories, tag, and taxonomy. These additional templates provide greater flexibility for content creators. Tailor each with the tools you already know or with the following new options in this release:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Featured images can be used in the cover block.</li><li>New featured image sizing controls make it easier to get the results you want.</li><li>While editing a template, at the root, or between blocks, the quick inserter shows you patterns and template parts to help you work faster and discover new layout options.</li><li>The query block supports filtering on multiple authors, support for custom taxonomies, and support for customizing what is shown when there are no results.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Browsing footer patterns in the quick inserter\" class=\"wp-image-12890\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Integrated Patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns will now appear when you need them in even more places, like in the quick inserter or when creating a new header or footer. If you’re a block theme author, you can even <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-patterns/\">register patterns from the Pattern Directory using `<code>theme.json</code>`</a>, enabling you to prioritize specific patterns that are most helpful to your theme’s users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Additional Design Tools</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Design tools grow more powerful and intuitive with each release. Some highlights for 6.0 include:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A new color panel design saves space, but still shows your options at a glance.&nbsp;</li><li>New border controls offer a simpler way to set your border exactly as you like it.&nbsp;</li><li>Transparency levels for your colors allow for even more creative color options.</li><li>Control gaps, margins, typography, and more on a collection of blocks, all at once, in the Group block.</li><li>Switch between stack, row, and group variations to position groups of blocks with more layout flexibility.</li><li>Use the gap support functionality in the Gallery block to create different looks – from adding spacing between all images, to removing spacing altogether.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Selecting multiple blocks in the list view\" class=\"wp-image-12891\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Better List View</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>New keyboard shortcuts enable you to select multiple blocks from the list view, modify them in bulk, and drag and drop them within the list. List View can be opened and closed easily; it comes collapsed by default and it automatically expands to the current selection whenever you select a block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Unlocking the block in the block toolbar\" class=\"wp-image-12892\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Block Locking Controls</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you can lock your blocks. Choose to disable the option to move a block, remove a block, or both. This simplifies project handover, allowing your clients to unleash their creativity without worrying about accidentally breaking their site in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Improved Performance in WordPress 6.0</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This release includes several updates focused on improving the performance of WordPress.

If you find compatibility problems, please be sure to post detailed information to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">support forums</a>, so these items can be investigated further prior to the final release date of May 24.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Review the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/05/03/wordpress-6-0-field-guide/\"><em>WordPress 6.0 Field Guide</em></a>, for more details on this release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Review additional information on the full <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-0/\">6.0 release cycle</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes+6-0/\">6.0-related developer notes</a> in the coming weeks which will detail upcoming changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Translate WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English? <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help translate WordPress into more than 100 languages.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h1>How to Help Test WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for issues is critical for stabilizing a release throughout its development.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:00:40]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Y&#8217;all, we&#8217;ve got an absolutely jam-packed couple of weeks in WordPress. We&#8217;ve got events happening and releases shipping and contributor days being coordinated (I almost said contributor days being contributed). That&#8217;s also what they&#8217;re doing. I&#8217;ll share some of those highlights in today&#8217;s small list of big things, but I did want to specifically call out something that&#8217;s coming up this week on Thursday (May 19, 2022), and that something is Global Accessibility Awareness Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team of contributors over on the Accessibility team has participated in the Global Accessibility Awareness Day in the past. So I thought it would be interesting to hear from one of the co-founders of this particular day of awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:27]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. And with that, Joe Devin, would you like to tell us a little bit more about yourself?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:01:34] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure. So I am the co-founder of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, which is a day that goes viral every year on the third Thursday of May. We typically have the Twitter reach on the GAAD hashtag on Twitter of 200 million users, which is, I think, pretty much their active user count. We stopped counting once we hit their daily active user count. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, I am Chair of the GAAD Foundation, which we launched last year. And then I have a day job too, where I&#8217;m CEO and co-founder of Diamond, which is an inclusive digital agency that builds software accessibly by default. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:15]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wonderful. Well, we are so excited to have you today. I said we like it&#8217;s me and the mouse in my pocket—we in the WordPress community that&#8217;s going to listen to this. Super excited to have you today. So you mentioned GAAD, Global Accessibility Awareness Day. Last year was your 10th anniversary, which is very exciting, but like with so many good things, I hear it all started with a blog post and a blog post on WordPress, no less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;d love to hear about how GAAD evolved from that, with, as I understand it, your co-founder of Jennison (Asuncion). That must be where you met him, I assume.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:02:51] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Yes. So what happened was I started a WordPress blog called <em>My SQL Talk</em>. So it&#8217;s a database blog, and I just thought it was a brilliant name. I mean, My SQL Talk, like that, should be super popular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it probably had maybe ten people who ever looked. Um, and then my dad was getting older, and my dad was a survivor of the concentration camps, and he was a genius. He spoke ten languages. It, he was one of those people. That, when he walked into a room, he just commanded respect. You knew that there was history. I don&#8217;t know how to explain it really, but it was special when my dad walked into the room. And considering all of this that he suffered in his life, watching him get older and struggle, particularly with his banking, was very painful to see. And the bank wasn&#8217;t accessible, so I wrote this blog post proposing that we create a Global Accessibility Awareness Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes I get these visions, and they never turn into anything. But while I think about it, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;all right, let&#8217;s write this blog post and this can definitely work. Right?&#8221; And then you finish the blog post to hit send, and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;this is not going to work.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I wasn&#8217;t even smart enough to do social media on it. But fortunately, WordPress had an auto-tweet feature, and it tweeted it out, and Jennison Asuncion, my co-founder, happened to be around and not out that Saturday night. And he read the blog post, and he said, &#8220;this is a great idea. Let&#8217;s make it happen.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we had two busy people, but we both had a community. He had the accessibility community, and I was building a tech scene in Los Angeles. And what I discovered is if you combine a great idea with the community, great things can happen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:49]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh man, you&#8217;re speaking my language over here, helping people find their communities, knowing that community is the thing that is the lifeblood of society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That sounded like a tautology. It is not a tautology. You can have a society with an attempt to not have any sort of community around it, but I bet it doesn&#8217;t work very well. Well, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s very interesting. And so you all just kind of talked through what that would look like, I assume in confidence, or that would have to take place, right? Or was it on Twitter in those days?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:05:24]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, you could still look in the comments and see the back and forth of Jennison and a bunch of other people that got pretty involved with GAAD that are some legendary folks in there. It&#8217;s kind of mind-blowing because I dunno how, how you feel, but for me, when I used to code, uh, three months later, I&#8217;d look back at old code and be like, &#8220;oh, I suck,&#8221; you know, or write an email even and you look back on it a day later and are like &#8220;what a stupid email, how stupid am I?&#8221; You know?  But I look back on that one after ten years; I was scared to look at it because I&#8217;m like, it must&#8217;ve been really bad. But you know, it kind of held up, and exactly what I wrote in there happened &#8211; to my utter shock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:06]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, it&#8217;s kinda nice, though, to look back and be like, &#8220;oh, I used to be much dumber.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cause then you&#8217;re like, look how far I&#8217;ve come. I&#8217;m no longer that dumb. I&#8217;m a different kind of dumb now; good for me. I always hope to be a different kind of dumb as I go forward. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So then, okay, so that was your ten-year anniversary last year. GAAD, in general, now has been going on for 11 years, and at the time of this recording, in a couple of weeks, but then probably a week when it finally publishes, you have your next, your next round of that going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it seems safe to assume that awareness of the need for accessibility has increased during that time, but we all know that the work of accessibility is ongoing. And so, I&#8217;m just curious to hear from your perspective if the awareness of the need for accessibility has generally started to permeate developer communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And are you seeing more developer awareness around the need for accessibility in tech in general?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:07:12]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. You know, it&#8217;s not enough. It&#8217;s certainly improved a lot.  I keynoted a conference probably four years after GAAD started, maybe five, and I kind of assumed nobody would have heard of accessibility, and I was taken aback when I asked who had heard of it, and a good chunk of the room had. So even then, there had been a difference, and I&#8217;d say now I see accessibility mentioned a lot more in conferences and stuff. But when it comes to actually building it, there&#8217;s a tremendous amount of ignorance. There, there still needs to be a lot more awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think partially people are a little bit scared to dip their toe because they&#8217;re scared that they&#8217;re going to be told that &#8220;no, it&#8217;s not accessible,&#8221; or that they&#8217;re going to say the wrong word or offend somebody. So I&#8217;d say that there&#8217;s some degree of trepidation, but also developers, and it&#8217;s not just developers, designers, and product people. There&#8217;s so much to learn, and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;oh God, there&#8217;s another piece that I have to learn.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m so glad that you invited me on this podcast because it&#8217;s the developers that, you know, I am a developer, not anymore, I haven&#8217;t touched code in years, but that&#8217;s where I came from. Right? This is my peach, right? Particularly WordPress folks, because I had done a fair bit of WordPress before I moved on to some other things. And, I think we have to talk about usability and understand that accessibility is so much more than how we look at disability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;m going to ask you a question. How do you think the typical WordPress developer or designer would define disability? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:05] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>in the kinds of conversations that I&#8217;ve had over the years, it frequently has to do with visual things. Because it&#8217;s just screens all day, right? And that&#8217;s a primary area where our designers and developers really have made some effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But my personal favorite sort of, of example, for like, when you&#8217;re looking at how to make sure that your products are accessible is, what, if you have to use your website, or you have to build your website using only one arm. Because that gives you an opportunity to kind of look at disability from a permanent standpoint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like if you have lost permanent use of one arm, but also gives you an opportunity to look at the temporary options for that sort of lack of mobility. Like you&#8217;re a mother with an infant, and so you have to be able to, you know, get your stuff done with one arm. And so I know that we paid a bunch of attention to screen readers and what works in not way back in 2018 and 2019 did a lot of work with. Literally zero screen. And can you still do the thing that you need to do, which was incredibly difficult. And I was really excited to see what our developers came up with around that. But I think that that is quite a bit of that discussion as we&#8217;re going through it from the beginning to the&nbsp;end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:10:27] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I mean, that&#8217;s a great answer, and you definitely understand some of the nuances way better than I think that the average creator, digital product creator, I&#8217;m including the, you know, the product people, the designers, and the developers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re very fortunate to have more than just developers in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:10:50]  </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason I bring this up is that the WHO (World Health Organization) had to; they&#8217;re the ones that did massive research across the globe. And they had to, they had to come up with a definition, and in their definition, they needed to draw a line. Typically, I don&#8217;t remember the exact thing cause it&#8217;s a 350-page report, and I kept looking for where they defined it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a little hard to find, but essentially it&#8217;s if there&#8217;s a major disability or a disability that impacts some significant portion of your day-to-day activities. And that&#8217;s really great when you&#8217;re trying to do a report on how many disabilities there are out there; what percentage of the population has a disability?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And their figures are something like 15% of the population has a disability, which is a huge number. But at the same time, they also mentioned that 2.2 billion people have a visual impairment. And we also know that over 33% of the population is over 50, and I&#8217;m included in that population. And I can say that when you&#8217;re over 50, you know, I&#8217;ve got clouds in my eyes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know where they came from, but they definitely make it harder to see. When I&#8217;m in a restaurant, I can&#8217;t focus on the person across from me the same way. My hearing is not the same, and anybody over 50 is going to have certain impairments and won&#8217;t see as well; color contrast issues are a big deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being able to raise the font is a big deal. And I think that accessibility is connected in most people&#8217;s minds with disability. And they&#8217;ll attach that to something like being blind or being deaf or hard of hearing or having a missing limb or having some other kind of disability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, as a result, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;well, I don&#8217;t even know any people in that category possibly,&#8221; and as a result, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;well, how important is this?&#8221; Yes. They might feel guilty. I should do the right thing. This is the right thing to do. But honestly, like how much money should I spend on it? How much, what percentage of my time should I spend on it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t realize that everybody has different abilities. And so, I&#8217;m starting to go away from even talking about disabilities and asking people to remember that all of us perceive things differently. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you remember the gold dress where they were trying to say, what color is this dress? Is it gold and white or blue and black? And it is blue and black, but to me, all I see is gold and white. And then there was Laurel or Yanny. Do you remember that?. And some people heard it, and typically older people heard it as Laurel, and I&#8217;ve, and I do this in some of my presentations. I play that, that sound. And usually, it&#8217;s Laurel for me, but sometimes it&#8217;s Yanny. Even personally, it changes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, we have a totally different perception. Now think about memory. There&#8217;s a different kind of blindness. If you try and remember, let&#8217;s say a relative or a friend that is no longer. How well do you see that picture?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because for me, it is very, very vague, but for some people, they say, and I&#8217;ve been asking people, and I&#8217;d love your answer as well. How vivid is it? And some people say, I can read the, I can see the pattern on the shirt. It&#8217;s as vivid as if I see with opening my eyes, seeing, you know, the regular in front of me, and I can even read a name tag in the memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m like, Woah, so maybe I&#8217;m blind in a way. Right? So how do you see it? How do you remember things?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I&#8217;m a, I&#8217;m a real visual person and a tactile person. And so, like if I interacted with someone, I&#8217;m very likely to be able to picture, like, recreate that mental picture pretty well in my mind. I recently, very recently, met some of my first people in that executive leadership space who were like, yeah, I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t visualize things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was like, what are you, how do you do this work? Because like, you have to be able to do that. And they were like, no, I don&#8217;t have mental pictures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:15:13] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people don&#8217;t have an inner dialogue.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:17] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t understand that either,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:15:19] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me either. So accessibility studies all of these differences with respect to how you&#8217;re presenting all of this information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t pay attention to accessibility, you&#8217;re really just missing out. And then there&#8217;s colorblindness. If you&#8217;re creating something like slack that has an online/offline indicator, and you only use red and green for people who are colorblind, they see gray and gray. And so what I&#8217;m trying to teach the community with digital product creators is that no, you cannot ignore it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can ignore accessibility, but then you&#8217;re not good at your job. I mean, I don&#8217;t mean to say it in an offensive way, but you&#8217;re not good at your job if you&#8217;re unaware. If you break a rule on purpose, great. But if you don&#8217;t know the rule, it&#8217;s just a lack of craft, and you absolutely should make it a priority.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;re not doing it as a charity. You&#8217;re doing it because you care about your users, and you care about your craft, and you want to build things well, and it&#8217;s a necessity. And I think that this is the kind of message that our community needs to hear.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:16:31]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to touch on something that you sort of brought up a bit, um, at the start of the answer there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you brought up the concept of usability. And in the last time that I did a podcast about accessibility, I defined accessibility as a subset of usability. Do you think that if we were to consistently draw that line for people so that it&#8217;s not just like accessibility is this thing that you should do outside of usability?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we were to more consistently draw that line, do you think that that would help people to see and understand better that its shades of existence, usability, and accessibility?  &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:17:10] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, 100%, a hundred percent. And in my company, we kind of realized that that&#8217;s exactly what we have to do. We have to see this as usability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t, we talk about accessibility a lot, but I don&#8217;t want to. It&#8217;s part of the plumbing for us. We&#8217;ve made it part of the plumbing, and I can tell you it&#8217;s a struggle to take accessibility and make it part of an organization, even when you&#8217;re bringing it top-down, believe it or not. For our teams, particularly the designers, they are blown away by what they&#8217;re learning because they&#8217;re improving their craft.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And design is typically where there&#8217;s a struggle to get accessibility accepted because there seems to be a very strong idea of what a design should look like. And I think it&#8217;s really about the approach because UX and design it&#8217;s all about empathy for people. And when you approach it, not as, even though empathy should mean that, that, you know, do the right thing at the same time, it&#8217;s more about empathy for your user, and your user includes so much more than just people with disabilities that you haven&#8217;t run into somebody that has that disability and therefore you build it better, and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s completely blown their mind. They love it. They love doing it. And I&#8217;m not hiring people with accessibility coming in. We&#8217;re training them to work accessibly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:18:34] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it&#8217;s interesting that you talk about empathy as part of being able to make sure that you&#8217;re creating something that&#8217;s accessible because I actually feel like empathy is. Like it&#8217;s being considered this gold standard for many, many things right now. And I think it actually is more harmful in the long run than instead making altruistic choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, I have a blog post that I will link in our show notes that will kind of help everybody see more fully my concept there. But when you rely on empathy, you do kind of have to rely on one, being able to run into all of the issues you were mentioning. You have to know people who have problems in order to know that the problems exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you also kind of have to assume that once you have willingly put yourself into the discomfort of that kind of disability, whatever, wherever it exists on that spectrum, your experience of that discomfort is the same as someone who lives with it. And I just don&#8217;t think that we can necessarily do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always think that trying to do the altruistic thing, like doing your research and figuring out what it is and trying to make decisions on behalf of other people as best you can, which is a terrible thing. Still, like decisions that take into account the experiences that people are sharing with you and then going to them and saying, &#8220;does this make that experience better or worse?&#8221; is the more sustainable option from my perspective, this is specifically leadership. Still, I think it&#8217;s true for accessibility as well, and probably product design as a whole, but it&#8217;s very difficult. Like people really feel like they understand the concept of empathy right now. And I do think that sometimes that leads us down the wrong path for things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s your thought on that? I think you kind of agree based on what your answer was&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:20:33]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, no, absolutely. And you know, we, you, can&#8217;t never about us without us, as the common saying, and we&#8217;ve gathered a group of a hundred people with a wide variety of disabilities for research. Whenever we do any UX and research, and sometimes we&#8217;re asked to just do research projects, we go out and ask the users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had some really interesting companies approach us to do innovation and accessibility, and they had strong assumptions. We looked at the assumptions and agreed with it, but we&#8217;re like, all right, they were smart. They said, &#8220;vet this with users for us, please,&#8221; because they didn&#8217;t want to gather their own group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We vetted with users, and we&#8217;re blown away, always blown away because there are so many things you just don&#8217;t know unless you&#8217;ve lived with a particular disability. You can&#8217;t guess, and you&#8217;ve got to speak to your users and a wide variety of them. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:21:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. What role does open source play in expanding accessibility, either in specifically the digital space or just accessibility in general?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:21:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess if the question is, what role does it play? I would say the role it plays is it is, unfortunately, it makes accessibility worse because, for the most part open source is not very accessible. And it&#8217;s a personal passion of mine, so I&#8217;m really glad that you brought that up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, it is so bizarre. You write a blog post and then it goes viral, and it goes viral every year to a degree that you can&#8217;t even believe it, that all these companies that you know are running events. Privately, publicly talking about it. And then you get all these people thanking you for what you&#8217;ve done year after year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then one year, you read on Twitter, The Blind Onion; I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re familiar with The Onion, the satirical clip, there&#8217;s the Blind Onion. And they tweet out, &#8220;Now that Global Accessibility Awareness Day is over, we look forward to 364 days of global accessibility oblivion.&#8221; And that really hurt at the time, but at the same time, and I was told to ignore it, don&#8217;t worry about it, but I&#8217;m like, no, this is coming from a place of pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the point of GAAD was to make a difference. It wasn&#8217;t too to just give everybody an opportunity to say, &#8220;Hey, look at what we&#8217;re doing,&#8221; and then not make a difference. So, as a result of that, I started to think about, well, where are we with this? And, and so I&#8217;ve created a state of accessibility report that through my company, we&#8217;re able to run for a few years, and it&#8217;s not, you know, the state is not great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m like, well, what can we do to change things? So, as a result of all of this, I really wanted to figure out, well, what can we do to make sure that GAAD does make a difference? And so, I came up with the idea of the GAAD pledge, which is specifically meant for open source frameworks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the idea of the GAAD pledge is that an open source framework, when they are ready, takes the pledge to make accessibility a core value of the framework. Now, terms of what that actually entails are different for every single project because every project is unique. We did create a bit of a framework, which had the idea of saying, okay, you&#8217;re going to, first of all, create an accessibility statement that says that this framework is going to conform to whatever, WCAG, which is Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, to whatever WCAG level is decided and is appropriate for the framework. That there&#8217;s going to be documentation for anybody that is downloading this piece of open source project and trying to implement it, that there should be guidelines for them, that all of the examples should be accessible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s really important because even the frameworks that try to pay attention to accessibility. You&#8217;ll often see that people from the community will provide examples, and they&#8217;re inaccessible. And it&#8217;s really sad when you see that because so many people are just copy-pasting. That&#8217;s typically how it works, and they&#8217;re going to copy-paste something bad. So putting a statement around it, I think, would be really great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what we&#8217;re hoping to see is that lots and lots of big open source communities decide to take the pledge. And then it&#8217;ll sort of be table stakes that any new open source projects as well look, all of these frameworks that made it, they took the pledge and therefore we should take the pledge as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the very first year, we had React Native take the pledge, and they put a lot of effort into their accessibility. The second group to take it was Ember.js, and they always put a lot of effort into their accessibility, and they continued that effort. We&#8217;re about to announce the next one, but we&#8217;re still two weeks away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I can&#8217;t say anything yet, but yeah, we&#8217;re, uh, we&#8217;re hoping for a lot more uptake on, on the gap pledge because it, it affects so many people downstream. WordPress&#8217;s what percent of the web right now? 43%? So there you go. That&#8217;s so many people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:25:57] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So many people. Yeah, fun fact Gutenberg, our current rewriting of the editing experience in WordPress, primarily uses React. And so, I&#8217;m glad to hear that they have taken that pledge as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with any good cooking, it starts with good&nbsp;ingredients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:26:12] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You said it. That was great. I wish I was a cook, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:26:23] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love it. All right. Let&#8217;s what keeps you up at night when it comes to the state of accessibility?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:26:29] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What keeps me up at night is how to move the needle. It is such a big thing to change. And there are so many angles that you can approach this with, but at the end of the day, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a monster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a monster. There are so many legacy sites out there. If you look at WebAIM, they do a yearly report on the state of accessibility as well. They call it the WebAIM Million, and they&#8217;re typically seeing 97% inaccessible, 98%. It goes up and down a little bit every year. And that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s just a huge boat to move.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we need to at least get the newer, uh, newer websites and mobile apps to move. And what we&#8217;ve seen in our state of accessibility report is that only the very top companies seem to put in the effort to make their products accessible. There is a big push with the enterprise companies to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CEOs are starting to talk about it, but what we need is the entire culture of software development to change. Or I should even say digital product development change and to move that boat is massive. And that&#8217;s I put it in my tagline in my email like that&#8217;s my mission in life, and I hope to achieve it before I die.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that keeps me up at night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:27:52] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that would keep me up at night as well. I mean, it seems like you are really just personally mission-driven and impact-driven. Do you feel like, in the event that the work that you&#8217;ve accomplished so far is what you accomplish, you feel still like you&#8217;ve had an impact?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like you have had&nbsp;an impact. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:28:13] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not one of those people that tries to have a legacy or like tries to focus on what my impact is and all of that. I just try and do good work. And hopefully, it just shows at the end of the day. I&#8217;m just trying to have the impact without the accolades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:28:34]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get it. Well, Joe, thank you so much for joining us here on this episode of WP Briefing. You have been a delight to chat with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:28:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, it&#8217;s really been a pleasure to meet you, and uh, and I appreciate the opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:28:54] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it&#8217;s time for our smallest of big things. As I mentioned at the start, it is packed. Number one tomorrow, May 17th, RC3. So one of the final RCs that we&#8217;re going to have for the WordPress 6.0 release, unless something goes horribly, horribly wrong, which I don&#8217;t think it will. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, two days after that, Global Accessibility Awareness Day, as I mentioned, will be on May 19th. So, this coming Thursday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then next week, we have the 6.0 release. We have the WordPress 6.0 release on May 24th. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> Three days after that, WordPress turns 19 on May 27th, starting its final teenage year before we turn twenty in 2023. So that was the rapid-fire dance card for the next two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stuff that is happening with and around WordPress for everyone to know. As a heads up, also, many people are headed to WordCamp Europe in Porto(, Portugal). The first week of June, I am going to do a live from WordCamp Europe episode. It will not be live. I&#8217;ll just record it live. And so. You know you&#8217;ll get to hear me with my hoarsest voice and maybe singing to my computer. Cause that almost always happens at these things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12855\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"WordPress 6.0 Release Candidate 2 (RC2) Now Available for Testing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/05/wordpress-6-0-release-candidate-2-rc2-now-available-for-testing/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 10 May 2022 18:06:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"6.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12840\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:171:\"WordPress 6.0 Release Candidate 2 is now available for testing!

It was the cheapest and most flexible way to get a website started for my fledgling explainer video business, so I used it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a long time blogger and website-maker, since the days of GeoCities, I was very confident I would find WordPress a breeze to use. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>I opened up a fresh new install of WordPress for the very first time in my life and was confronted with an intimidating admin interface. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The stuff on the right seemed meaningless and unhelpful, and the stuff on the left was way more complicated than I was used to. What did media library mean and when do I use it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was lucky that I’d been making websites and blogging since I was a child. It was also a good thing that I knew WordPress was really <em>really</em> popular. Had it not been for those two things, I would likely have given up. Instead, I powered through, confident that, if millions of people could figure it out, I could too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After some tinkering, and reading recommendations, I purchased and installed a page builder, Thrive Themes, and started building my site. I watched many tutorials, made tons of mistakes, and got frustrated countless times. But after a month or two, it finally felt like I’d gone from pushing a boulder uphill, to chasing the boulder downhill. Incidentally, I still use Thrive today!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"kt-adv-heading_262ee3-78 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Why Open Source Matters</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I owe a big part of my journey to the open source nature of WordPress. Being able to play around for almost no money allowed me the freedom to experiment and make mistakes with little penalty. I didn’t have to worry about paying $50 or even $5 per month for each random side project I start, which allowed me to play around and really deepen my knowledge of building websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>I bet lots of other people attribute their web building journey to WordPress and open source too. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And that’s likely to be a large reason for WordPress’ popularity. It’s free for anyone to use, so lots of hosts offer it as one of their default options. There are also loads of plugins out there that help you turn your WordPress site into anything you can possibly imagine. It means that a receptionist or a journalist can move from one job to another and easily log into their company’s website, update the opening hours or write a blog post, because everyone is on WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It means a first-time business owner like myself can create their first website and not worry about making newbie mistakes since the cost of wrong decisions is low – it’s really easy to migrate from host to host, change themes, remove plugins and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"kt-adv-heading_c0af34-ca wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Where&#8217;s It&#8217;s Not Perfect</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>However, open source is not without its drawbacks. Like I mentioned above, the first time I logged into WordPress I found it overwhelming. It’s hard to draw a direct line to the exact reason why, but here are some of the reasons that came to mind:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, there isn’t a dedicated team with KPIs to hit who are focused on making onboarding super easy for complete beginners. In commercial software, this is typically a top priority as customers who can’t get onboarded, will usually churn, which loses money for the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, in WordPress, we have contributors who are typically seasoned WordPress pros. They no longer remember what it’s like to use WordPress for the first time. And because of the contributor model, we also don’t have enough teams with dedicated UX researchers, product managers, and more for each aspect of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, WordPress is largely built by developers with a developer-first mindset. Thus, the teams are conceived from a developer standpoint (performance, multisite, etc) rather than from a user standpoint. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>For example, it would be wonderful to have teams focused on the experiences around onboarding, dashboard, plugins, themes, which is how the average user mentally structures WordPress.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, it’s impossible to keep track of usage data, so there’s no way to know where people are struggling across the entire WordPress project. This matters because the best way to justify having teams focused on certain aspects of WordPress is to present numbers. However, since we don’t have numbers, it’s impossible to present a strong case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final issue is that WordPress is gigantic. It powers everything from The American Whitehouse website, to small businesses in Singapore (like mine). This pins WordPress in a very tricky spot, because the needs of the Whitehouse are very different to the needs of a small business on the equator. And any updates that are made to WordPress have to take the breadth of use cases into consideration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, I’m glad that WordPress is open source, even despite the drawbacks. It helps so many people grow their businesses, communicate, and simply share their thoughts with everyone on the internet. There is no such thing as only good without the bad. And I’m glad WordPress exists.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-in-wordpress/\">The good, the bad, and the ugly in WordPress</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 00:00:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Lesley Sim\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 6.1 Release Candidate 1 (RC1) Now Available\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13579\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/10/wordpress-6-1-release-candidate-1-rc1-now-available/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9422:\"<p>The first release candidate (RC1) for WordPress 6.1 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>This is an important milestone in the 6.1 release cycle. “Release Candidate” means that this version of WordPress is ready for release! Before the official release date, time is set aside for the community to perform final reviews and help test. Since the WordPress ecosystem includes thousands of plugins and themes, it is important that everyone checks to see if anything was missed along the way. That means the project would <em>love</em> your help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.1 is planned for official release on November 1st, 2022, three weeks from today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This version of the WordPress software is under development</strong>. Please do not install, run, or test this version of WordPress on production or mission-critical websites. Instead, it is recommended that you test RC1 on a test server and site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test WordPress 6.1 RC1 in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 1: </strong>Install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (select the “Bleeding edge” channel and “Beta/RC Only” stream).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 2: </strong>Direct download the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.1-RC1.zip\">RC1 version (zip)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 3:</strong> Use the following WP-CLI command:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>wp core update --version=6.1-RC1</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional information on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-1/\">6.1 release cycle is available

The shop currently distributes its <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/hestia/\">Hestia</a> (100K+ installs) and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/neve/\">Neve</a> (300K+ installs) themes on WordPress.org, commercializing pro versions with upgrades and support. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/raft/\">Raft</a> is the latest addition to the lineup.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to full-site editing support, the WordPress directory still leans a little heavy on blog themes, but Raft was designed to suit a wide-ranging variety of use cases, as stated in the theme&#8217;s description:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;It’s perfect for blogs, small business, startups, agencies, firms, e-commerce shops (WooCommerce storefront) as well as personal portfolio sites and most types of projects.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the default homepage looks simple, it&#8217;s the block patterns that make this theme ready for anything. Raft includes patterns for creating a cover image with title and background, image galleries with a title, post query loop, two columns for features or services, three columns of features, call to action, FAQ, inverted background, and a hero section. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>When users first install the theme, it prompts them to install the free <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/otter-blocks/\">Otter Blocks</a> plugin, which adds more page building blocks and customization options. Raft also has compatibility with Elementor, Brizy, and Beaver Builder, in addition to Gutenberg, and support for WooCommerce. The Pro version of Otter Blocks contains more advanced WooCommerce blocks for building complex store layouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>After activating the theme on a new install, clicking &#8220;Customize&#8221; takes the user to the Site Editor where it will be pre-filled to look nearly identical to the <a href=\"https://themeisle.com/demo/?theme=Raft\">demo</a>. There&#8217;s not much to the demo &#8211; it keeps the pages fairly simple and <a href=\"https://demosites.io/raft/patterns/\">showcases the patterns</a> on a separate page. Raft isn&#8217;t quite a blank slate but it does leave some room for the imagination, as it&#8217;s not stuffed full of content and animations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme comes with eight beautifully designed style variations, each with harmonious color combinations that create a different vibe for the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />image source: <a href=\"https://themeisle.com/themes/raft/\">Themeisle</a>\n\n\n\n<p>Rift packages full-site-editing templates that users can edit to further customize the main pages like 404, single blog posts, the front page, archives, and more. It also includes a blank page template.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Themeisle markets its popular classic themes on WordPress.org with pro versions that include starter templates, additional header and footer options, custom layouts, WooCommerce layouts, and other features. The company has not created a pro version for Raft. They may still be developing upgrade options but the world of blocks changes the game, since custom layouts are much easier to create with the block editor. User expectations are different.

Dan Soschin has posted the update <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/10/wordpress-6-1-beta-3-now-available/\"><strong>WordPress 6.1 Beta 3 Now Available</strong></a>. You can help test it by following the call for testing </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Sneak Peek: The meta-team just released the <strong>beta version</strong> of d<a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6059\"><strong>isplaying Style Variations in the Theme Directory</strong></a>, a trac ticket opened by <strong>Carolina Nymark</strong>.  You can browse an <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentytwo/?beta=style_variations\"><em>example with the Twenty-Twenty-Two theme. </em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developer <strong>Steve Dufresne</strong> <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6059#comment:17\">commented </a>:  &#8220;To turn on the feature, add <code>?beta=style_variations</code> to the URL. The URL gets updated when you browse themes, so you&#8217;ll need to re-add it for each theme page and reload. If nothing loads, there are most likely no style variations for that theme—your best chance of finding them is in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/\">&#8216;Block Themes&#8217;</a> category.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you click on the small variation card below the screenshot you will notice that the screenshot changes to show in with the variation applied. Very slick. The growing interactivity on the Theme directory makes it great fun to spend more time browsing themes and be fascinated by all the creativity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Reminder: This is still hard hat area, travel at your own risk. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/poe/?beta=style_variations\"><img /></a>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>WP Briefing &#8211; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/10/episode-40-all-things-testing-with-special-guests-anne-mccarthy-and-brian-alexander/\"><strong>Episode 40: All Things Testing with Special Guests Anne McCarthy and Brian Alexander</strong></a>, and they discuss with host Josepha Haden, their work on the Testing Team, the FSE outreach program and how to get started with testing in the WordPress project.

Although the shortcodes still work, the block versions allow for much easier customization with a better UI. One example in the announcement is the Order History block. The previous Purchase History shortcode output a simple table of orders, but the new Order History block has a card style view and allows users to easily modify the number of columns and how many orders are displayed per page. </p>\n\n\n\n\n<img />Purchase History shortcode output\n\n\n\n<img />New Order History block\n\n\n\n\n<p>The other blocks have been updated in a similar fashion, with extended functionality and greatly expanded customization options. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that the new Checkout block was released in beta. It is not turned on by default for new stores yet. Users who want to test the block will notice that EDD has reordered some of the fields to improve conversions, improved the user context detection (only showing necessary fields to users), and redesigned the payment method picker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Email Summaries is a new feature for store owners in 3.1. It sends a weekly or monthly email to the admin or other custom recipients with a store update that includes metrics like gross and net revenue, new customers, and average order amount. It can also be disabled in the admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>A few other notable changes in version 3.1 include the following: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>New setting to require users to login to download files </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Success Page has been renamed to Confirmation Page to differentiate it from the receipt</li>\n\n\n\n<li>More detailed views and filtering options for Reports</li>\n\n\n\n<li>reCAPTCHA keys added to Downloads » Settings » Misc so users can automatically enable reCAPTCHA for the lost password and the registration forms</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New color options for purchase buttons</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New &#8220;View Receipt&#8221; link in the orders table</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/\">Easy Digital Downloads</a> is installed on more than 50,000 WordPress sites.

Feedback on the event was all positive, mostly due to the non-lecture way that Allie presents on the topic, and also the workshop approach to challenging the attendees to think about their current beliefs and how they consider themselves allies, how they think they can do better, and how we can all challenge ourselves to think about our place in the community to one another. I consider myself an ally, and I look for ways that I can improve continually, and this workshop helped me move forward in that even more. If you weren’t able to attend, you can still purchase the event and watch it online.

The report contains data on page content, user experience, content publishing, and distribution with contextual insights from subject matter experts. It draws from a dataset that evaluates millions of web pages and is continuously updated on a monthly basis. Metrics from the June 2022 crawl, used for the report, are <a href=\"https://github.com/HTTPArchive/httparchive.org/blob/main/docs/gettingstarted_bigquery.md\">publicly queryable</a> on BigQuery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/cms\">CMS chapter</a> is of particular interest to WordPress users and product developers. HTTP Archive&#8217;s dataset, which is based on <a href=\"https://www.wappalyzer.com/technologies/cms\">Wappalyzer’s definition</a> of a CMS, identified more than 270 different CMS&#8217;s. WordPress is still leading the market with 35% adoption on mobile—followed by Wix (2%), Joomla (1.8%), Drupal (1.6%), and Squarespace (1.0%). </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast to W3Tech&#8217;s stats, which show <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-attributes-declining-market-share-to-performance-issues-increased-complexity-and-the-lagging-full-site-editing-project\">WordPress market share declining from March &#8211; June 2022</a> and then holding steady, the Web Almanac shows WordPress up 1.4% over 2021 on mobile and 0.2% over 2021 on desktop. The methodologies differ in that W3Tech includes only the top 10 million websites in its statistics, as defined by the <a href=\"https://www.alexa.com/\">Alexa</a> top 10 million and the <a href=\"https://tranco-list.eu/\">Tranco</a> top 1 million list. The Web Almanac&#8217;s data set includes 8,360,179 websites, where 7,905,956 are mobile websites and 5,428,235 are desktop websites. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drupal and Joomla are slowly declining and Wix has grown over the past three years, though it still represents just 2% of the CMS market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New in the data this year is the top five WordPress page builders. Wappalyzer&#8217;s detection found that 34% of the WordPress websites in the dataset are using a page builder plugin. It would be interesting to see these numbers compared with how many sites are using just the block editor with block plugins, along with sites using the Classic editor and no page builder, but this wasn&#8217;t part of the data collection here.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Elementor is the most popular among the page builders, sitting at 40% of desktop sites and 43% of mobile WordPress sites. WPBakery is not far behind at 34/33%, followed by Divi, SiteOrigin, and Oxygen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As we see it today, page builders exert significant influence on the performance of a site,&#8221; CMS chapter author Jonathan Wold said. &#8220;Historically, page builders have been anecdotal indicators of poor performance. As one example, our dataset indicates that it’s not uncommon for websites to have multiple page builders installed, adding a significant increase to the resources loaded by a site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Now that we’re tracking page builder data, we’ll have the opportunity in future editions to evaluate year-over-year changes in page builder adoption and look for correlations in those changes to the overall performance of WordPress as a CMS.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Web Almanac also published data for Core Web Vitals performance and the results vary widely across CMS&#8217;s. Duda, a drag-and-drop website builder used by less than 1% of websites, is posting the highest numbers with 67% of its sites with passing CWV scores. TYPO3 (62%), Jimdo (61%), and Drupal (50%) are not too far behind. WordPress, which had 19% passing last year is up to 30% in 2022, and is catching up to Joomla (38%) and Wix (39%). Scoring consistently high on Core Web Vitals is more difficult for CMS&#8217;s that are primarily hosted independently around the web, as opposed to a centralized SaaS platform, so improvements here may be more hard won.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The report goes into more detail on the top platform&#8217;s performance across specific metrics, like Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS). Median Lighthouse performance scores for most platforms were low and in need of performance across the board. SEO scores are consistently high across all of the leading CMS&#8217;s. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The median Lighthouse accessibility scores for the top CMS&#8217;s ranges between 77 and 91. WordPress falls in the middle with 86 and Squarespace scored the highest in this category with 91.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report also includes a few other interesting WordPress-specific charts, such as year-over-year adoption by geography. WordPress appears to be the most popular in Spain (39%), Italy (38%), and Japan (38%). </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The Web Almanac also published data for WordPress origins with passing scores for Core Web Vitals by geography.

Challenges arose with reliable project management on the agency side while they tried to establish a foothold in the WordPress plugin market after a first attempt with themes. The <strong>WooCommerce Extensions Store</strong> is where their business took off. With niche extensions that had no competition, they ranked very quickly. Other ideas for plugins solved problems in custom development projects for clients. Eventually, the Keiths developed a formula for evaluating new plugin ideas. Learn from their challenges and successes — there are a lot of interesting details that only come from experience. Hosted by <strong>Cory Miller</strong>.

The way communication has happened — or hasn\'t happened — about this decision is clearly damaging trust in the WordPress community, particularly among business owners with a product in the plugin repository. Ny points out how this all looks to a newcomer to the WordPress community — again, trust takes a beating. But while we lack clarity about the po.  ssible return of install data in some form, Dan suggests asking why this data is trusted and valued by many plugin owners. What business decisions can it helpfully inform? Are there alternative and possibly better sources of data about a plugin\'s users? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, Dan briefly talks about the emergence of draft legislation in the US Senate: the Securing Open Source Software Act. It seems likely that in the near future, US security agencies will be getting people, dollars, and new organizations involved in assessing risk in open-source software. Are WordPress auto-updates critical supply chain infrastructure? When should individual freedoms be exchanged for collective security? When do we need to know what our machines and software are doing? When don\'t we?

How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Okay. I think! We\'ve got quite a few things cover here, but I think today, the first — the first is probably a topic all onto itself. Something you could spend a lot of time on!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like I\'m in the role of like bringing, bringing someone to the family Thanksgiving dinner and having to explain like&#8230; Oh yeah, <em>Uncle</em>—</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They said <em>that</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Oh yeah, So , I wrote an article at Master WP about microaggressions. Mm-hmm. . And you know, usually when I do my social commentary, I do tie it to tech. And I mean, the reason I wrote it was tie it to tech issue, Twilio and claims of reverse racism and hiring and [00:01:00] things like that. And affirm of action and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I saw the conversation around this tech conversation was that, you know, a lot of microaggressions, which I talk about is like, you know, unconscious bias and basically racism. Um, so I was like, you know what, this seems like something that the community really needs to learn about and hear about. So, took my wonderful African American studies degree in research background, , and um, you know, did a good article on microaggressions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. , which led to more microaggressions. That let this hate mail led to me taking a little break from Twitter. But, um, I guess that\'s addressing the elephant in the room. But I mean, I look at it as something as I still don\'t regret writing it. I don\'t regret what led up to writing it because we have a good number of people in the community who are very informed and they are very.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, resp receptive to information like this. I got a [00:02:00] lot of support. I got more support than hate. Okay? So I want to do, I do wanna acknowledge that, but there are quite a few people in the community who actually, you know, they need this information and they ignore it. But you know, that\'s not going to stop me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And although I\'m taking a break from Twitter, you know, it\'s because, you know, I have a lot of other things going on. Um, yeah. So I\'m perfectly fine and I can\'t wait to get back on Twitter cuz I\'m really gonna argue. Yeah. I\'m ready to argue with people. , I\'m just kidding. But I, no, I do miss Twitter. It\'s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s nice connecting with people of the community. Yeah. Be in a meaningful way. And like I said, there were lots of people who were like, you know, I really needed to hear this. Like, this actually changed my perspective. I think I might buy a book, one of the books you recommended, Things like that. So, Oh good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I can help one person, like that\'s all, that\'s all I need. I don\'t need a, A group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I think it was really good article. I, I haven\'t heard all of the, the stuff that you covered and you did have a, a bibliography at the end, so Yeah. Mm-hmm. , people [00:03:00] wanna read, click through and, and, and get into some more. Um, I thought it was pretty generous and even handed things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s interesting people. Triggered about it because you were pretty clear that microaggressions are, are things almost anyone can do to anybody else for any number of of reasons. Um, but, um, I don\'t know. I\'m, I\'m always, I\'m surprised, not surprised at the kind of reactions that you, you get, um, when you touch these, these subjects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know it\'s, it seems pretty much that women. are the, the targets of, of that when, when there\'s equity and inclusion and justice type subjects that come up. Um, and that kind of bothers me. We talked about that a bit before. Mm-hmm. , the kind of, what I wouldn\'t say it even approaches hate mail and we get the kind of angry I\'m leaving, [00:04:00] I\'m unsubscribing it, you know, you shouldn\'t talk about this stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s always anonymous. Um, that comes to me. The, the stuff I\'ve seen, um, that post status gets, Um, I, I think your experience is quite a bit different and that kind of concerns me that, um, people getting, I think a, a pretty, even, even handed and calm, even like calmer than , a very tolerant response to. Some tough issues where there\'s, there\'s definitely kind of abusive things going on out out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, the reaction is more of the same a as you said, directed very personally from people who are using their work accounts to do it. And they\'re not hiding their identity at all with you. I don\'t know what they\'re afraid of. They don\'t do that with, with us, but it [00:05:00] kind of, That doesn\'t speak to anything good if they feel confident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, just cutting loose on, on you, on, on women who write, um, something that they don\'t want to hear. And it is, it is exclusively men as far as I\'ve ever heard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah. Um, As, as you said, as we talked about people, as you saw on Twitter, people are writing from their Twitter accounts with their WordPress information in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. They\'re sending it from their business address that. Their business, their business, email addresses that have their addresses and phone numbers and stuff. Mm-hmm. , that\'s what\'s, uh, . It\'s interesting to me because even if you, I, it\'s a disrespect thing, honestly. Let me, let me go back. They do it because it\'s, they know like, I can say this to you with my chest, and there\'s no repercussions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or they think, they think that, right. And, um, it\'s a disrespect issue. It\'s always amusing to me. Going back a little further to what you said, you were like, you wrote it very like, you know, without emotion. Objectively, I\'ve, I\'ve seen a [00:06:00] lot of people say that. A lot of people said this to me. Mm-hmm. , they were like, this was written like a research paper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Because, you know, one, it was. Two. The biggest thing that I want people to know is that I don\'t have the luxury of being able to be emotional in writings like this. When I write about my race and my gender or things that I have experienced, and the moment I show any sign of emotion, I\'m the wrong person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn\'t matter what the other party did to me, right? Because there\'s this big, uh, I don\'t know what you would call it. It\'s this big theory with people discount your experiences and they say it\'s because you\'re emotional. It\'s because you\'re looking to be a victim like you in, like, I enjoy stuff like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\'t enjoy racism or racist people. I prefer to pretend they don\'t exist. That if I could do that, that\'s what I would do. But, um, I just couldn\'t show emotion. And it\'s been a while since I\'ve written like that. Um, I\'ve been able to show emotion for a while, but I knew with this I couldn\'t. And you see with that, we still got hate mail</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, uh, I got told I was being a victim of, I was like, Of what? [00:07:00] No response. I was like, What am I a victim of? I\'m like, I\'m, this is, I have. Micro aggress against people. I\'ve used ables language, you know, not knowing I\'ve said things, um, toward people that I didn\'t know was harmful. And it was important to me to unlearn that I don\'t care if I didn\'t do it on purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I\'m like, Doesn\'t everyone feel like this? No, they just rather not be told that they\'re doing anything bad at all, ever, even if it\'s unintentional and even if it hurts people, but you know, that\'s them. But for everybody else who wants to learn, I\'m always here .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, it\'s, uh, definitely worth checking out if, um, if you haven\'t seen it enough with this woke stuff and other racist speech you can unlearn, which I think is very inviting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, uh, and yeah, that, uh, it, it can be unlearned that\'s a, a positive. Um, yeah, I\'ve seen mail come in about that, complaining that we don\'t want to hear anymore [00:08:00] of this. Change your thinking, change your mind. Woke stuff. Too bad. Yeah, too bad. Uh, everyone who has that kind of reaction is just a voting for doubling down on, on bigotry or the idea that they have nothing to learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and yeah, I know, I think that\'s a pretty honest and good generous starting point that we\'re. There\'s, there\'s not really any way through life and relationships without stepping on people\'s toes, and sometimes intentional, sometimes unintentional. And if you don\'t learn from that, you\'re, you know, that\'s, uh, at some point it\'s not ignorance anymore, it\'s intentional damage you\'re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but I\'m, I\'m glad you wrote it and I hope more, more people. Engage with it, read [00:09:00] it and think about, think about it. Um, I, I think, uh, it\'s a tough one. Cause you, you also tackled the myth of meritocracy, which will die hard in, in tech. Um, , you know, I, everyone\'s a victim who hasn\'t earned their way up or, you know, proven their worth or, or mm-hmm achieved something that I consider, you know, notorious. Yeah, that\'s, there\'s a lot, there\'s a lot more going on in here than I imagine people think who just dismiss it at the title. So that\'s, uh, it\'s definitely worth, worth going through. And honestly, it\'s not in my time. I, I don\'t think this is something we\'ve talked about a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\'t think it\'s come up, um, a ton in, in just let\'s talk about. Kind of, um mm-hmm. conversations. [00:10:00] Yeah. In reaction to bad events. Un unfortunately in problem individuals and, uh, conflicts that come up. So it\'s, it\'s worth, it\'s worth having that conversation as a running one. And I hope the, um, diversity inclusion, um, equity approach to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To the, to not just events, but um, to, um, to help people, um, look at each other and relate in general will. We\'ll make that more of just, this is, this is just normal, right? . There\'s, there\'s a lot of different cultures and perspectives and age groups represented in a large, large community like WordPress and having an open door and open conversation on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s good. Um, anything else you wanted to [00:11:00] get into? About that. I know there\'s, there\'s so many big things looming behind it, but yeah, you need some time to rest, recover, and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Um, not many big things for me. Um, I just want people to, I, I was worried people were thinking, um, especially the first few days I was off Twitter that I was like somewhere crying. I\'m not,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Oh geez, , no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> This man could not ever in a million years make me cry, baby. But , um, it has encouraged me to keep talking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, if, if the reception was a little more tame, , I definitely probably would\'ve said, You know what? Okay. People heard and they understood. The pushback has made me want to talk about it even more. Mm-hmm. , So I\'m, I\'m cooking up some things and we had Ally, uh, Neon\'s workshop on how to be an ally, which, um mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>talked a lot about microaggressions and a lot of things we were experiencing cuz Ally\'s been through the re, through the wrong. Is that the expression? Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Through the [00:12:00] ringer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Through the ringer. Especially when you talk about, you know, racism in Europe and, you know, Yeah. You can\'t even talk about racism in Europe according to Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, um, and I\'m going to talk about it. So, and I\'m going to Word camp. I, I don\'t care if no one has Christmas, I\'m going to work Europe next year. But, um, Yeah, we\'re, we\'re gonna keep talking about it. I, I hope to see more workshops. I may do one I don\'t know yet. Um, I\'m gonna keep, I\'m gonna keep talking about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If, like I said, if I\'m only reaching one person out of all the people that this goes out to, that\'s fine. Yeah. ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Good. No, um. I, I, I think, uh, anyone who thinks that you were off Twitter for any of those reasons is just out of , out of touch. No. Yeah. Pin pinned your flow foot to the floor with a steak knife.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Got bigger. wasn\'t a steak knife, but was a Japanese, a big</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> shift [00:13:00] knife.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> The sword.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> It was a Santo chef knife. It was very sharp. I sharpen it every week. It was an, it was a beast. Let\'s, let\'s embellish this story. Oh. And then, Yeah. I don\'t, I know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Jump me. I told you I don\'t, I don\'t want to talk about sharp needles, knives every, you know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh man, we won\'t, We\'ve been through that. I\'ve been upset when that happened. I was like, Oh, oh, oh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> oh. But I just wanted it to be known. It was not a state knife I could have handled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> No, it was huge. A state knife. Yeah. Yeah. It was. Uh, well, I, I hope that that recovery. Goes really well and admire your, your spirit, but it, it is good to get off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is good to get off of the social media and I\'m glad for the supports you\'ve got and the team that is always seems to be a hundred percent behind you and is good with disagreement and, and some amount of, of [00:14:00] tussle and stuff. And, and that\'s. That\'s probably a good move in a good way to move into the, the bigger, the bigger topic in most people\'s minds for this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, um, yeah. Um, I, I really think the macro microaggression and how people teach, uh, how, how they treat each other. . Um, it\'s just a huge thing on onto itself and it really affects, it impacts trust and I think that\'s the theme, the theme here. And it\'s, it\'s always one in open source and in communities and in relationships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How, how healthy is our level of trust? Um, For each other. And this, uh, this active install growth chart issue going away has certainly touched a lot of people\'s nerves and confidence or, or trust for, um, their relationship with.org and how things work there. [00:15:00] Have, have you, uh, what are, what are your, what are your thoughts on that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s, I guess nothing\'s really changed in a week as far as I can tell this morning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> That\'s a spicy topic. I don\'t know. I don\'t wanna say the wrong thing. I\'m just kidding. You know? Nah. Um, , no. Um, that was a very interesting topic. Um, I have not jumped a lot into plugin developing. Plugin development. I\'ve wanted to, that\'s something I have on my to-do list for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, there\'s so many different aspects of WordPress I want to kind of jump into cuz it\'s very interesting. I don\'t, and I\'m, I\'m being honest, like I don\'t really know how to feel because I\'ve seen both sides of it. Um, you sent me some good information. We had a very good article. Um, I don\'t wanna Bri pronounce his name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Mark Zara. Mark. He\'s a great guy. He\'s, um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> he is, he is awesome. Um, he had a article by him. Oh, go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Oh yeah, he, he brought [00:16:00] it to everyone\'s attention first, I believe. Um, yeah, so for those. Have been under rock or, or new to all this , I think it was late Thursday night, um, a week ago. Um, uh, uh, someone who works for, for Audrey Capital, um mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you would assume like directly. Responding to, to something Matt had re requested, took down the, uh, re reverted the changes in an old track ticket that in 2017, introduced the active install charts that are in the advanced section on plugins, um, in the WordPress DO org plugin repository. So, Plugin owners and really everyone can go in there and see a somewhat obscured, rough estimate of, um, how many sites appear to have your plugin installed on it at the, within the last 24 hours and.[00:17:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then over time, how that needle moves. Is it, is it going up or down? And, and if there\'s a, a growth or decline trend, what\'s that line averaging out to? So that\'s been there for a while and, and people really, a lot of people have really relied onto it. And that just went away with a ticket that just said it\'s insufficiently obfuscated data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So clearly there\'s, there\'s sort of an implication and then further things, there\'s definitely a security issue. The attempt to put out, to make some data public and not all of. Um, completely exact and comprehensive and available to everyone. That wasn\'t the attention, but some, some entity, um, with the capacity or more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know a lot, there\'s a lot of services and people who scrape that, who pull that data in some way. Um, To get a fix on the market, on to offer it as a service to look at other, [00:18:00] your plugins, your competitors, how things are going. Um, that was just pulled and there\'s co, the, the primary code involved, um, is not public, is not out in the open, and it\'s what would be receiving the, the pings from all the sites and interpreting them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As, Okay, does this count as a live site? If so, score one and then making that available through some kind of API where you can pull, um, pull out your current active installs. That too, that\'s the part that apparently has a security privacy issue and needs attention and, um, that has not been formally, officially.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly publicly stated, there\'s a discussion in meta slack, uh, mechan and WordPress slack, where this, you know, if you wanna read through, read between the lines and [00:19:00] people unofficially, but who I think are, uh, uh, totally trustworthy and, and know enough about what\'s going on. You can figure out what\'s happened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s the article I put together. Uh, trying to take that as at face value. Um, that appears to be what\'s gone on. And you see the, the reaction if you were a plugin owner. In the,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I wanna pause on something you said. You said, Well, if you know that these people are reliable, the right people are telling you the right things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if you\'re a newbie like me right to this and you don\'t know these people not saying they\'re not true. Exactly. I don\'t, You know, I, I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> My thought, Who is Triple J? Why should we trust him?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> No, I wouldn\'t say that. I\'m just like, I\'m going off what you\'re saying. You\'re like, Well, these are the right people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I\'m like, Well, you know that. How would I know that? You know? Yeah. That\'s me not playing devil\'s advocate. Cause I think that\'s stupid, but I, that\'s me just like waiting in, like I, I don\'t really [00:20:00] personally know these people. I, I get. , I get the side, I get both sides. Again, because one, I, I looked at it when I was deciding on plugins that I didn\'t really have a lot of information a on because, you know, the more people that seemed to be using it mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>the more reliable it seemed. And so, I mean, I definitely get that as a consumer. I\'m definitely like, Okay, I\'m gonna do a little bit more research and, you know, I\'m lazy. So, you know, that\'s on me, that\'s on them, that\'s on me. But I, I get where plugin owners are panicking over that. Like, it\'s, it\'s their money, it\'s their business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I, I get that. And then like, it does not seem to be a lot of clarity on it. Like especially when it went down, like it just went down like, ugh, you know, we need to fix this. Mm-hmm. . And it was kind of like, that\'s it. And it. , Right? What can we get an explanation? And it\'s like they have to dig, dig, dig.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I\'m, I know speculation is bad in general, especially when you don\'t have all the facts. Um, so I know there\'s been a lot of speculation on what\'s really going on and why it was really taken down, you know, outside of the few statements we got. But [00:21:00] do you blame them? Can you blame them? Like, if you\'re in the dark, all you can do is guess, I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. And that\'s not helpful from the, from the, um, from a normal corporate communications or community management standpoint. Mm-hmm. not having, not having an internal PR arm, not having some means of, of communicating to stakeholders in ways that calm things and, and spread correct information. Um, is it just.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who does that? So I think a lot, a lot of people feel disrespected, but this isn\'t a new thing. Um, they should know that it\'s, it\'s that way. It\'s been that way for a while and I would assume it\'s wanted to be that way. Um, but if, if you were expecting or wanting something a little more standard, that is not, not the [00:22:00] case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it does lead to people getting wound up. Speculating wildly and, and, uh, with distrust, uh, is spreading a good deal with distrust. And I think that\'s, that\'s what people are going to do every time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I mean, and I\'m, I\'m with you on that. It\'s been this way for a long time, so people are pretty much, um, You know, a lot of people pretty much expect it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they\'re like, Well, you know, these things happen. That\'s one way to look at it, but I would like to quote the Great American Television Show The Wire. Oh yeah. And say the thing about the old days. Is they The old days, ,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Was that bunk who said that? I think</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> he did. Yeah. It wasn\'t, Yeah. So, um, This is the thing, like, again, me just looking at this from my perspective as a newer person, if I\'m, if I don\'t know to expect these things, how can I expect them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right? Like, that\'s a lot, a lot of things happen in community, even outside of this, where it\'s like, well, that\'s how things have been done. And it\'s like mm-hmm. . [00:23:00] Yep. What am I supposed to do? , Like, I, I, Okay. Like I have to, There\'s no onboarding to how things are done. We\'ve talked about,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> That\'s a big issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is your onboarding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah. So it\'s like, Trial by baptism. Trial by fire. Yeah, that\'s what I mean. But you know, and I know some people, some people who are still having these conversations, they\'ve been in the community and they\'re used to this, but I mean, it could be, they could be tired of it. They could want change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I, I do agree with you saying like it\'s, it\'s gonna spread a lot of disinformation. No, you didn\'t say disinformation. It\'s gonna spread a lot of disagreement and we really don\'t need that. At all. You know what hashtag WP Drama. Um, but I mean, people also need answers. It\'s like I don\'t have a clear answer for what they should do because when I\'m confused and I feel like I\'m in the dark and nobody\'s giving me answers, I\'m definitely going to complain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And sometimes when you complain, it turns into hashtag WP Drama .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Oh yeah. That\'s almost inevitable. And so seeing it both ways, [00:24:00] Um, it, it shouldn\'t be Mark coming into Post Slack and in Twitter and saying, Hey, did anyone notice this ticket that just kind of crept in there and late Thursday night and, Hey, look, this chart\'s gone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, that\'s. At once, kind of highly irregular. But then again, is it, is it really to me for this, for this family?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> To this family, I guess not like I\'m the, I\'m the, the, the daughter-in-law, I guess I\'m married into this family. Yeah. I\'m at Thanksgiving. Like, Huh, ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> No, I feel like, yeah. Well, sorry you married into the mob.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, . I apologize for uncle over here. . Um, well, yeah, I, I think trying, I always try to see things multiple ways and, and look for what\'s the most. [00:25:00] Most productive way forward that will align the most people in a understand productive way And what can be learned here? Um, I, I\'m willing to, because John James Jacoby stepped in and is a real long timer and is on the Medi and the ME team\'s a bunch of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good people. Mm-hmm. who, um, were not apparently in the decision making about this, but have some degree of knowledge and oversight or independent, um, takes on. On the non-public code in question and have made it, and I see no reason to, to distrust any of that. So what, what has come out short of it? Not a press release, not something on even the taverns not, you know, being, being quite critical and not not getting any special, um, quotes from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside explaining this, um, what we\'ve got is what\'s come out on the, on the [00:26:00] ticket and it, they\'re saying it\'s a security issue that the either privacy, security, the, the way the data, um, was being pulled and used was over line that they were. Not willing to tolerate going on, and they want to change how that data access works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I also trust them that it\'s gonna come back at some point. But what\'s muddied the waters is Matt has, um, disregarded the um, The desire for the, the, the crowd that calling for like a full explanation and, and just kind of leading it going forward with the discussion of, well, what is this data that you want?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, what would, what helps the most? Um, and trying to kind of move things i I, in this direction of competition, how do we promote cooperative competition, Cooper competition, Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> ooh, let\'s make that [00:27:00] a word. .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> So it\'s a tough pivot to not to say, Hey, don\'t, let\'s not give you any kind of, we can\'t give you any full, There\'s not even official statement saying, We can\'t officially disclose what\'s going on here, but we\'re trying to remedy it in the meantime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, There\'s a couple of paths, how this could come back and how it could look, what\'s your feedback and input on that. Um, that\'s kind of what\'s being attempted, but the room temperature isn\'t really conducive to the most, um, helpful feedbacks, but just for me, just in watching, I\'m, I\'m, I haven\'t seen a lot of people explain why that one number is so important the way they think it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and it makes me think like if you\'re that fixed on this thing, that could come and go, that wasn\'t there before. And none of the really big businesses are, [00:28:00] um, they\'re, they\'re not living and dying by this, and I\'m not sure anyone really is, you know, eggs all in one basket. Like really, Um, this is a, a wake up call I would think that if, if that\'s how you\'re running your business or you, you think it works that way, maybe you need some other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other ways to analyze your success or, or, um, decline in with your customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Okay. I, I can\'t agree with you there, , but can I cannot, can\'t, cannot. I cannot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Oh. Oh, really? What do you, what what, I mean, what about it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Like you said, that\'s, that\'s all fine and dandy for the bigger corporations, but for the smaller person, it\'s like, Whatever, Figure it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find another method. Oh, well I, again, you said this is how it\'s been done, but it\'s like, how many times can you do that to people? Honestly, [00:29:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I, Yeah, I think that\'s a separate thing, right? If you kind of put that aside, this isn\'t a great way to, this isn\'t a great way to handle a community. Um, it\'s not a great way to handle business community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, It is what it is. It\'s happening. We put that aside. That\'s happening. Why do, why do you, you know, even if this hadn\'t happened, why is that? People saying that they go to that chart multiple times every. It only updates every 24 hours. And like the, the, it\'s general, it\'s kind of shotgun analysis. So I would say like maybe a week\'s worth of data would give you, it\'s just kind of a thumbs up, thumbs down on what, on install activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s, that\'s for your free plugin. So if you\'re trying to make, um, if you\'re, your revenue stream is coming elsewhere from a premium product or, or something else, um, this is just people who are trying you out or using. The free [00:30:00] version and it\'s, it\'s just a general pool of, um, not, um, Well actually you can, you couldn\'t, um, you may, it may include, I guess it would include both, but once you have paying customers, I would pay attention to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have direct, you have a bit more direct, um, access to them and focus groups. There\'s a lot of things you could, you could do to, um, to get better. Data on how your, your product\'s being used and there\'s other ways to distribute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> You don\'t think that would be a lot on smaller business owners, people, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Sure. It\'s a lot. Um, and I, it\'s always kind of surprised me though, how, um, how. There\'s, there\'s just, Well, you know, everyone wants an easy, an easy way forward, But does that really, does that really substitute for, um, real business intelligence, for real customer [00:31:00] feedback from real contact and relationships?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, the people I\'ve seen who seem to effectively build a, um, a small plug-in business who in intentionally are, you know, they\'re not trying to build. Thing at scale. They\'re, they\'re trying to do a company of one. Um, they promote it from the beginning on their, on their own channels. They know more or less who they\'re talking to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\'re soliciting feedback. Maybe they have the, the code on GitHub, um, or wherever it is. They\'re engaged with a lot of people using it. I just, I don\'t see why a single measure as vague as that one is. Such, such an obsessed over, um, detail. I mean, I, I understand, I hear what people are saying about it. I get that mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>but it, when you actually literally analyze it as like, is, does that make good business sense? I haven\'t, I haven\'t seen that. [00:32:00] The only, the only good one is, and I think it\'s, it\'s kind of a painful scene, but, um, Matt said about this, the same thing people. See it as a thumbs up if they see it going up, it\'s a motivation to keep working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s like, okay, that\'s valid. Like that. That\'s good feedback to give. Um, but what, there are all these other reasons people talk about why this is a, an important business metric to them. And I just, I think almost all of those are highly, highly questionable or at least, you know, you could probably get better information Another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> independent, like, so I, I\'ve never ran a plug-in business. I don\'t know if you have, you have a lot more experience than me. So, I mean, well we aren\'t we just speculating on what they can do. Like, you know, I, I trust Mark, Mark said that was one of the only tools they had, so it\'s going to make it a lot more difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, like, I think that\'s worthy of them [00:33:00] complaining. I think if that was their only tool, like I, I don\'t know. I can\'t, I can\'t like jump in and say, Well they can do this, they could do that. They could go do this cuz I don\'t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Well, but it\'s their, It\'s their only tool. Cause they\'ve allowed that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\'ve allowed that relationship to exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> So it was the easiest. And they like just kind of, I. It\'s, it\'s the easiest tool. So they kind of, it was easier for them to latch onto that instead of doing like alternate things, which they can do now. Is that what you saying? If it\'s,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> yeah, if it\'s really true that, that you put your, your business in the hands of a freemium type of product and the free versions in the repo, and this is the only measure you have of, of your potential market size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s choices you made. I, I . I mean, there are a lot of other, And you went in someone\'s house and, and this was here once and, and some years ago it wasn\'t there. And, um, I, I understand why that, that feels like a, a breach of trust. [00:34:00] But no one ever had a contractor understanding. To the other one, to anything different that this is, that they have a right to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> uh, I think the analogy is, you know, you went into someone\'s house and they said, Hey, it\'s an open. And you can use this thing right here. And they\'re like, Okay. And they use it for years and then they walk into the house one day and it\'s gone. And the person\'s like, Well, it\'s gone. Oh, well tell me why you needed it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Well, it wasn\'t quite that, It was more like someone, someone\'s been coming in the back door in the kitchen and they took the beer cooler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah. Someone else has been like sneaking in and doing bad stuff and now everybody, we can\'t pay forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> We gotta go to the, Yeah, we gotta shut this down and, and go and address this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> but there was no communication on that. I found out about the, the communication is cut that through somebody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> There\'s, there\'s two levels. If you look at it, there\'s a, there\'s a much higher level thing here with how much bigger entities are using this data. Mm-hmm. and potentially abusing it, and the need to get everyone on the same page, and [00:35:00] everyone has the same data and even has the ability to hide it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don\'t want your business exposed or your dad exposed that maybe that you can, you can put a privacy control on it. Mm-hmm. , but the, the rank and file the small. Smaller business entities that are upset because they\'ve really been relying on this. Um, totally understand that. But it, it does raise questions of why you have that level of dependency and does this number really do all that for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is your business truly going to, to tank or suffer in some way with without this and could having it taken away, whether are your options, do you. Are there any kind of creative ways forward then? Um, I, I would think that there, there are, having watched that space enough and how different businesses operate partly in using the repo, not using it, um, and how they do their marketing, how they do their relationship with their [00:36:00] customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I, I think it. It\'s something that matters a lot to people, like you\'re saying, who are, who are small and maybe don\'t have the capacity, um, or it\'s a part-time thing or a side part project. Mm-hmm. , and they\'re leaning heavily on this rather than other things that maybe they don\'t have time to be doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it raises questions about what\'s ineffective, um, business model, what, what\'s good data and how do you get it? And, I think that there\'s, from above, there\'s a bit of an attempt to push that question on that part of the business community. And I don\'t know if that\'s an effective way to do it, but it doesn\'t seem</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s not nice, it doesn\'t build trust. Uh, but I don\'t know, I don\'t know given enough, uh, pain points maybe. I don\'t know. We\'ll see where. Where it goes and the people caught in between on it, I, I feel for them. But, um mm-hmm. , [00:37:00] I don\'t have any, any reason to, to distrust those who have tried to be mediators and I, I think they\'re, I\'m glad they\'re, they\'re there putting, putting in their 2 cents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I feel bad that they\'ve had to be mediators. This is a, a lot to push on someone. It is, but I am interested to see where this goes. And I\'m glad people are talking about it. I, I, I know communication is a bit as of a doozy sometimes, but I\'m glad people are talking about it. Um, I\'m, I think we need to revisit it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Listen, visit this cuz what if it just blows over?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I don\'t think it\'ll blow over. I, I think it\'s, I don\'t, I don\'t either. It\'s like a watershed,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I don\'t think at all. . Yeah. But I\'m interested to see where it goes. ,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> but it, there is, there is some sense of, um, a desire to redefine that part of the ecosystem, that culture there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Definitely not wanting a [00:38:00] leaderboard of winners and losers or top 10 or something like that, but have some kind of helpful metric that motivates people that, um, is useful to them and isn\'t something that can be gamed and that someone higher up isn\'t pulling out and trying to figure out how can we game these stats or.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aggregate enough of this to, I don\'t know, build an even bigger secondary market for plugins, like a Zillow of plugin and that number is over your head as your business value and, and you wanna flip, you know, you wanna sell. Like this is, things have been moving in that kind of direction. I, yeah, call it financial, a financialized market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don\'t, I don\'t think that\'s really in most people\'s interests when, you know, it\'s like, When the housing market isn\'t people\'s houses anymore and or their homes or community or neighborhood, it\'s just, what\'s the number on this here today and what can I get for it if I were to sell it? Give me a number.[00:39:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, there was a bit, there\'s been a bit of a movement in that direction. I question the, the health of that, but it\'s really a question of pH kinda economic. Culture, open source culture philosophy. What kind of market ecosystem do you want to have? And I think from above they\'re being pretty clear that they want something more cooperative down there, which is tough for people to swallow because on a higher level, these are, they\'re the corporate entities that are playing full bore, um, corporate capitalism, you know, on a, on a higher level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. , um, where. No one\'s suggesting co-opetition between hosting entities. Entities I love, but maybe they should, you know, I mean, in a way, um, it is, it is throughout open source. I mean, there has to be some level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I\'ll suggest that on Twitter. Yeah. You\'ll be breaking with me. I, I think</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I\'m really like the cons really in, in [00:40:00] favor of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I\'m not a, I\'m not a unrestricted market person and I, I don\'t think the idea of a commons. works with that. You do need limits and at least a culture with some kind of consensus on, hey, we don\'t overly extract this here and there. And, but that\'s right. That\'s, that\'s not a conversation you can have in normal corporate America.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, Oh no, But it isn\'t, it is an open source thing and, um, how do we help each other grow? While in the midst of some degree of competition, um, that\'s a really worthy discussion. And uh, it\'s unfortunate. I think that the trust issues are high and the confusion and eventually misinformation may be high and we can\'t have that appropriate conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope we can, but mm-hmm. . [00:41:00] Yeah. Well enough said about that one. I\'m not gonna speculate where it\'s gonna go, but it\'s been a weekend. It\'s been a season,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah. Oh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> The um, the last thing I was gonna ta I don\'t think we\'ll really tackle it too much. No one\'s looking, no one\'s looking at this. Have you? Um, I haven\'t found a single person. I\'m, I\'m start. Poke around and mm-hmm. more technical sources. And I\'d really love for feedback from, from anyone who has, um, closer familiarity with government policy that\'s emerging around security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, there\'s a, there\'s finally, this stuff goes back a few years, but there\'s a senate bill, um, that\'s very specifically targeting open source and security and how we can, how things can be changed. [00:42:00] to, I think ultimately is, you know, it\'s about mitigating risk that, um, the US federal government, really any go, any government\'s always concerned with risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\'re highly invested in open source. Um, and it\'s not open source in particular, Most people will point out software across the board. Um, how can this be exploited and hacked has gotten into the public eye and into. , the, uh, the eye of people in, um, in government whose job is to focus on things like supply chain, security, that, you know, things that are considered public infrastructure, um, in a national interest that we need to secure and can\'t just have people hacking through, exploiting, you know, whatever they think is going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But , there have been plenty of examples and there always will. Will be some. [00:43:00] So we just, we haven\'t really seen that, um, that come down before and I think we will soon. So have you, have you seen anyone talking?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Not really. Um, it seems like something Rob would tackle, um, top Yeah, I think you\'d be interested, but, um, I\'m, My input is as someone who has worked for the state and federal government in a tech capacity, I don\'t have a lot of faith in this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right? Can I say that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Why? Get in trouble? I don\'t think you\'d be,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Will they come snatch my microphone? Yeah. bust through my window in the back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Um, you aren\'t gonna quote the giver, are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Oh, I got other quotes, but I, One per episode. It\'s all get, um, Oh God.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I\'m from the government and I\'m here to help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Please. No. Um. I, [00:44:00] I understand. Okay. The big, uh, the big hacks that have been going on, like the, having the Uber , um, you know, there are a lot of con security concerns out there. I get it. But I don\'t see, I guess I just don\'t know enough about this bill to see what they\'re going to do to help. I just feel like it\'s more government regulation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like I found very, I feel like I found very. Pro Capitalism this episode. Hmm. I\'m thinking</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> on the one hand. Yeah, but on on the other. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Ah, stop me when you see, when you hear stuff. I\'m just kidding. I\'m kidding. Um, dang. I do now I have to, I have to sit with my thoughts now. Um, no. I get the security issues, but I really don\'t see what they\'re gonna do to help, is basically what I,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Well, it is, I think everyone does have a common problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s mostly. D updates. . Mm-hmm. , The, and how they get. Um, so if you have unup updated, the, the largest problem, you have a really, really big [00:45:00] attack surface. Like the log four j log four shell thing was under the auspices of Apache Project. Uh, it wasn\'t that something wasn\'t unmaintained and, but there was, um, uh, a, a security vulnerability that was discovered that had been around a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just no one had noticed it. And then you needed to patch it quickly and, and distribute. All around something that\'s very widely used, and that is the, the tricky spot. How do you get mm-hmm. , you can\'t. So in terms of, of WordPress, there\'s all these really old installs out there. Mm-hmm. , Um, and some are so old, I, you can\'t push an update too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. , you\'d have to have anyway. Forced updates have become more of a, a less controversial thing. There was a day, oh probably. Not too long ago, year or two, um, when it was, it was controversial for, uh, again, a decision [00:46:00] made by through unknown processes and deciders to we\'re just gonna push a forced update on an insecure plugin or some core thing, um, that\'s emerged and, and that can be done just pushed down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that\'s just becoming more of, of the norm for security. Reasons and how that, there hasn\'t been a really discussion of that, how that fits in the ethics of open source. Um, if I choose to use this software, can you push changes to it against my, um, consent or without my consent and change my client\'s sites and stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, yeah, I think we\'ve kind of moved into a place where, It\'s kind of like getting a vaccination, like, like, Oh Lord, please, you wanna opt out? You wanna opt out to this? Um, there\'s a real problem, um, to doing that, but it, I mean, I, that too. I, I, These are, these are [00:47:00] two sides to the openness and, and freedom and rights, Individual rights versus collective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I will not be hopping into the vaccine debate. You know, I\'ll debate anything that is scary to me. , I\'ll still debate it, but people are scary when we talk about vaccines. I get scared. Um, but I, I think that to me, where it goes to me in my mind is for security updates. We don\'t talk enough about, about how computer illiterate, I guess is how you would.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm. A lot of society is getting, especially when you think about the younger generations who are dependent on their phones and tablets and they don\'t really know how to use computers anymore. Sure. It\'s like, um, you have older people who, you know, have struggled with that, and now we have a younger generation and then it\'s like us in the middle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think, I think that\'s going to be an issue because we\'re forcing people to. It\'s update and they don\'t know, You know, they know one version they [00:48:00] can\'t learn, or not that they cannot learn newer versions, but there is not a lot of adequate education out there to learn newer things. And I\'m not just talking about WordPress kind that\'s in my mind, but that goes through a whole host of other software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just, I think we need more literacy before we do stuff like that. I mean, I\'m not opposed to it at all. Um, I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> It would certainly help for trust again, like, um, if you, I think more and more people are just expecting and, and vaguely, maybe they don\'t even understand that their devices are being updated all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I monitored all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Definitely. Don\'t they? Definitely. Don\'t you remember when they said 5G was like causing covid? Did you hear that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Um, that okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Conspiracy theory. That was one. Yeah. Yeah. And I was like, What? And like it was, people were send me stuff, they were like, You\'re in tech. Is this true?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I\'m like, What? And I\'m like, Why would you even begin to believe [00:49:00] this? Where is the correlation? It\'s like people really don\'t. Anything . And it\'s like, you know, I\'m not calling people stupid or ignorant. Please, if you\'re listening and you sent me a covid conspiracy theory, I am not attacking you. Um, I, it\'s just that people are, there\'s too much lack of information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like that\'s the theme of this, uh, of this episode. If you don\'t give people enough information and literacy, they\'ll speculate. They\'ll create their own narratives and then they\'ll spread them. Right? And then we have all this what? And then we\'ll hear stuff when we say what. Yeah. What I do that like 16 times a day, so Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s, they, they have so much more to do than just force updates, but I don\'t have the faith that they will do that. That\'s me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Well, there, there\'s a lot, there\'s a lot that can be done in, in testing and and security practices to make more secure product, but there\'s always gonna be stuff that just needs a hot fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It needs enough to push to it. Dependencies that aren\'t even within the project, but that we use and that some other project [00:50:00] uses. Everyone\'s got to be able to, um, verify what they\'re using, what version it is, maintenance status, and how do you, how do you quickly update a lot of stuff across the network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that\'s all good, but yeah. What, what you\'re saying with a highly, with something, um, as ubiquitous as WordPress or. Apps on your phone. Um, people aren\'t, it\'s better if you can get them educated enough to trust that, okay, this is how this is done and mm-hmm people are trying to keep this secure and here are the risks and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, maybe there\'s some kind of catchall consent. If you know you\'re using this, this is what\'s gonna happen. It would be great if, as a community, talked more about those things too, and then mm-hmm. , um, informed people of, of what to expect about security with client work. It\'s totally, [00:51:00] absolutely necessary to, to explain about the importance of updates, maintenance, and security issues, and, and that being a constant ongoing process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when, when people don\'t understand and then something happens, you get what? The demonn haunted world. I keep thinking of this essay that that\'s a Carl Sagan book. And Corey doctor wrote a great essay a few years back when, when Volkswagen was uh, uh, gaming their catalytic converters or what, whatever that was when they, whoever hooked the hook, the cars up for testing to emission standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, it. The computer would realize, ah, we\'re being tested, so let\'s cheat. And we go into cheat mode and give a different output than, um, when you\'re on the road, you want more power delivered to the user and it\'s actually over emission standards. They got caught for that, but it was a sophisticated software [00:52:00] thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BMW did this to, uh, I wanna pronounce these in German way, Ba a. I, I don\'t know how many did this, but I was talking to a friend of a friend musician who bought one of their sprinter vans. He\'s really, uh, fancy bmw, um, vans, and they got, they had to do a recall on all their, Their catalytic converters, um, because they had a cheat system in it too, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they had agreed to some, you know, there was a, there was litigation and they just agreed to replace it all. Not that they had done anything wrong or something like that. And, and he was in the states, he\'s Canadian, bought this thing in, in Canada and it was in the States and the computer on the car, and his van started saying, You have 10 more starts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You gotta get this to a dealer, Do the recall, have the part swapped out, and if you don\'t and, and you need to do that in 10 more starts, you start, you stop and start 10 times this thing\'s not gonna, it\'s [00:53:00] gonna be towed, you know, It will not, your, your vehicle will no longer function. Um, so it\'s like ransomware built into thereby the, the manufacturer of your vehicle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, huge. Shift from . I don\'t think you knew that that was even possible. They left the thing running.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Well, , that reminds me. I do. Because that reminds me of the, the, I don\'t know if I\'ve never had it, but I\'ve known people who\'ve had these type of cars. If you don\'t make a payment on your car, you miss a payment, they cut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They really just lock your car and then you can\'t crank your car up. Yeah, you can\'t use your car. You\'ve never heard of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Like they do remotely through the card. They do it remotely disabled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I\'m, I\'m, I thought that happened to many people. Like I\'ve had people go to pump gas and then they can\'t crank their car up and they\'ll say, Oh, you owe it\'s money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> My car is older than my oldest kid. I have a 1997 crv. Like the early years were, were really good. I have a Honda [00:54:00] guy, um, who um, yeah, like, yeah, I\'m an old tech person, , so you couldn\'t Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> that\'s, but that\'s like, that was kind of old. That\'s like, I learned of that when I was like a teenager and that was like, oh my.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am about to turn 32. I was around 15. That was, I\'m doing math 17 years ago, .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> So yeah, I think that\'s, I stuff should be built to last some things and maintain. Oh yeah, definitely. And I don\'t like the idea of. Of being surveilled and controlled remotely. Oh, yeah. Um, and that\'s, um, that\'s the world we\'re moving into.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. and to some extent there, you know, well there\'s real abuse and ethics issues and uh, personal autonomy. And I don\'t think that kind of car system is at all what anyone in open source wants or, or just coming. But there\'s always a trade off to, uh, with security, how do we, how do we protect. [00:55:00] Ourselves, Um, the most people efficiently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it\'s, it\'s by overriding, you know, anyone who might individually say, Wait a minute, I wanna evaluate this update code before, you know, most people are just gonna sit on an unup updated thing and mm-hmm not know what\'s going on. And that\'s, um, ultimately you have authorities saying that\'s just not okay cuz it\'s a security risk to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much more, much more significant higher level interest than, you know, Bob Smith with his whatever software he is running. Mm. Well, I think that\'s a, that\'s just a fascinating, ethical, intellectual thing, and I, I hope, I hope that we can find a few people to kind of dig more into that as, as that goes along.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, um, yeah, trust. Everything\'s about trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> You [00:56:00] made me think about trust falls. Trust. Trust falls when someone like stands on a chair and you all hold hands. Oh, that,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. I\'ve never done that. Uh, no. I didn\'t</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> want, I was scared. Yeah. I didn\'t trust, I did not trust those people. But, but no, you\'re right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trust is, is that today\'s word? That\'s a big word for Elmo. .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Just cause people are being, just cuz people are being nice and communicating well with you doesn\'t, you know, you assume good intentions, but I mean, trust can be betrayed in so many ways or failed, um, even with the best of intentions. And I think how we recover from it, there\'s no ideal state, you know, no human group is gonna have pure trust unless they\'re completely in denial, like a cult or something about how everything is awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s always damage. In and histories of, of um, reasons not to trust each other in any long relationship. [00:57:00] And you kind of have to find a way to be resilient through that and recover from it and reassure each other. Yeah, we\'re aligned. We want the same things, pretty much. Um, I\'m not, I, you know, and I\'ve got your back and that\'s what we need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s hard to come by.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I agree. Trust in communication.</p>\n</div><p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 07 Oct 2022 14:16:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"<span class=\'p-author h-card\'>Olivia Bisset</span>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:117:\"Post Status: Diversifying Revenue, the 50% Coding / 50% Marketing Lifecycle, Active Install Clawback, and Turbo Admin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=127096\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:121:\"https://poststatus.com/diversifying-revenue-the-50-coding-50-marketing-lifecycle-active-install-clawback-and-turbo-admin/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5333:\"<div class=\"e-content\">\n<h2 id=\"h-wordpress-design-development-around-the-web-for-the-week-of-october-3\">WordPress Design & Development Around the Web for the Week of October 3</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-21 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-2-color has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">Here’s a glimpse of what’s going on in the world of design and development in the WordPress space this past week. As I look around the Post Status Slack and the chatter on Twitter, this week has been filled with conversations emphasizing the struggle of running a business as a solo devpreneur. </p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Diversifying Revenue Streams as a Solo Devpreneur</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Web Developer, Entrepreneur, Organizer, and <a href=\"https://carlalexander.ca/\">The Man in the Arena</a> Carl Alexander has shared his journey creating <strong><a href=\"https://ymirapp.com/\">Ymir</a></strong>, writing <a href=\"https://carlalexander.ca/object-oriented-programming-wordpress/\">a book</a>, freelancing, and how much he actually makes from all that to live each month. TL:DR; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/twigpress/status/1577668588923559937?s=20&t=fkpkDh0STrS3M6ql88yBIg\">Not as much</a> as you’d think. This kind of transparency into the entrepreneurship side of WordPress can be so valuable and helpful for everyone to see. I suspect many of us can relate to this, especially in the WordPress space where our abilities as developers, designers, and builders are often taken for granted or undervalued. Carl’s answer is creating a <strong>Github</strong> sponsored page, which is a great way to show appreciation for a developer\'s work, especially the free plugins that they maintain. <strong>Aurooba Ahmed</strong> has made <a href=\"https://github.com/aurooba/sponsor-wp-contributors\">a list of developers you can sponsor</a> as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The 50% Coding 50% Marketing Lifecycle</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We see it all the time: some application or website comes out with half the features of a similar idea you’ve been toiling away on for months, maybe years, but they get all the traction because they market the heck out of their brand. Chances are they also probably hired a small marketing team or agency to help them, and for many of us, we don’t have that luxury. Enter <a href=\"https://www.bannerbear.com/blog/why-you-should-do-50-coding-and-50-marketing-as-a-solo-tech-founder/\">the 50:50 concept</a> from <strong>Jon Yongfook</strong> of <strong><a href=\"https://www.bannerbear.com/\">Bannerbear</a></strong>. It sounds like it would be complicated but it’s really simple. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Oh Look, Somebody Took Something Away and Didn’t Communicate About It Well, That Tracs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This week’s #WPDrama has surrounded the abrupt removal of the <em>install growth charts</em> for security reasons on <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\">WordPress.org</a> and the <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511\">Trac ticket created</a> in response to that from Post Status member <strong>Mark Zahra</strong> which highlighted the frustration felt across the plugin community. I cannot stress enough that all of these frustrations could have been avoided by good communication with the community right after the removal. Instead, everyone was left to piece together different conversations on <strong>Twitter</strong> and <strong>Make WordPress Slack</strong> to understand what might be the future for getting similar or even better analytics into the <strong>Plugin Directory</strong>. As of this writing, there still is no response from the team that removed this feature or what a process might look like for future analytics improvements. Again, an open-source project the size of WordPress should have a team just to help write a synopsis of major changes so anyone can understand the why, when, where, and what’s next.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-22 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2>Cool Tool</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Each week we feature one cool tool that can help make your life easier as a WordPress builder.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Move Around The WordPress Admin Faster and Cleaner</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me introduce you to <strong><a href=\"https://turbo-admin.com/\">Turbo Admin</a></strong>, from Post Status member <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/magicroundabout\">Ross Wintle</a></strong>. This little tool makes the WordPress Admin feel more like using the <strong>Siri</strong> or <strong>Alfred bar by giving you a command palette</strong> and a few <code>wp-admin</code> improvements like being able to hide all notices. Turbo Admin is packaged primarily as a browser extension for <strong>Chrome</strong>, <strong>Edge</strong>, and <strong>Firefox</strong>, but it also comes as a plugin. What’s really cool about the extension is that you can use it on any site you have <code>wp-admin</code> access to with no need to install the plugin. This makes it very useful on client sites without adding another plugin to their stack.</p>\n</div></div>\n</div><p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 07 Oct 2022 13:45:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"<span class=\'p-author h-card\'>Daniel Schutzsmith</span>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"Akismet: New API Endpoints to Keep Track of your Akismet Usage\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://blog.akismet.com/?p=2429\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://blog.akismet.com/2022/10/07/new-api-endpoints-to-keep-track-of-your-akismet-usage/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:887:\"<p>We&#8217;ve recently deployed, and documented, two new <a href=\"https://akismet.com/development/api/#detailed-docs\">API endpoints</a> that can help you automate keeping track of your Akismet usage, as well as of which sites are querying our API using your Akismet key.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://akismet.com/development/api/#usage-limit\">Usage Limit</a>: an endpoint to keep track of your Akismet API usage for the current month.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://akismet.com/development/api/#key-sites\">Key/Sites Activity</a>: an endpoint to keep track of the sites that are using your API key.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>We&#8217;re Here to Help</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need help integrating with these, or any other of our <a href=\"https://akismet.com/development/api/#detailed-docs\">API endpoints</a>, please don’t hesitate to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://akismet.com/contact/\">get in touch</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 07 Oct 2022 13:41:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Stephane Daury\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"Do The Woo Community: WooBits: The Future HQ of Do the Woo in Porto, Portugal\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=73074\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"https://dothewoo.io/the-future-headquarters-of-do-the-woo-in-porto-portugal/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:421:\"<p>I haven\'t talked much about our move to Porto, Portugal and what this means to Do the Woo and its next iteration.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;

The one-day virtual event features 24 hours of talks on building accessible websites in WordPress. It is independently organized by volunteers from WordPress&#8217; Accessibility Team and other community members.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wpaccessibility.day/schedule/\">schedule</a> for the event is currently a password-protected page but should be available soon. The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCes9XCUZd51CAigbBEGlfNg/featured?view_as=subscriber\">YouTube recordings</a> for the 2020 event offer a good example of the kind of topics attendees can expect &#8211; building accessible menus from scratch, Gutenberg&#8217;s accessibility with screen readers, how to use ARIA in forms, essential HTML tweaks for accessible themes, and more. A single track will run approximately 26-28 presentations during the course of the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP Accessibility Day would be remiss without accessibility accommodations in place. Organizers are endeavoring to provide the most accessible experience possible with the resources they have, including the following: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Videos will stream via YouTube with closed captions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Transcripts will be available through StreamText.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Slido will be used for chat and submitting questions to the speakers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Opening remarks will begin at 14:45 UTC (11/2/2022 at 10:45 AM America/New_York) and attendees are welcome to join for any sessions throughout the 24 hours. <a href=\"https://wpaccessibility.day/participate/attend/\">Registration is now open</a> and it&#8217;s free to attend. There is also a $150 microsponsorship option. WP Accessibility Day has <a href=\"https://wpaccessibility.day/sponsors/\">16 corporate sponsors</a> who will provide attendees with virtual swag and prizes.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 06 Oct 2022 21:33:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"Post Status: WordPress 6.1 Beta 3  • Active Install Growth Chart\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=126644\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:112:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-6-1-beta-2-serverless-wordpress-annual-meetup-survey-catalyst-for-creativity-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16724:\"<div class=\"e-content\">\n<h2 id=\"h-this-week-at-wordpress-org-october-3-2022\">This Week at WordPress.org (October 3, 2022)</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">Help test WordPess 6.1 Beta 3!

A <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511\">ticket</a> calling for bringing back the charts is home to a heated discussion on the matter but so far the developer community has not been able to get any clear answers on why access to the data was cut off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his first response on the ticket, Matt Mullenweg asked developers to explain their reasoning for bringing the stats back, without communicating why they were removed in the first place, asking them to present &#8220;that side of the argument.&#8221; No decision makers have confirmed this to be a security issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511#comment:35\">second response</a> on the ticket evades the questions plugin developers are asking and instead states that the availability of an API for this data was never promised: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>As has been pointed out, there was never an API made for public use or with any promise of availability, people just reverse engineered and exfiltrated the data to create the chart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I definitely think we can show some more stats to plugin authors about their own plugins, and I&#8217;m hearing that for newer plugins every new install can be a motivator. Feedback loops are important. It will take some work but it&#8217;s doable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>While he seems open to finding a way to show more stats, Mullenweg did not promise the return of the active install growth data, the most important metric for plugin authors tracking the trajectory of their user bases. Many businesses rely on this data to make product decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think that one of the main things (from my perspective) is that this change has made us feel vulnerable and powerless,&#8221; WordPress plugin author Ross Morsali <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rmors_/status/1577612513256116224\">said</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m about to change a repo based on three years of work, and I won&#8217;t even know how it does until I lose or gain at least 10,000 users. Feels kind of insane, not a good foundation for my business.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Morsali <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511#comment:41\">commented</a> on the ticket to explain the importance of the data:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>It is literally the only way to know how your plugin is doing &#8211; which in itself, is pretty bad &#8211; the removal of it just put blindfolds on everyone &#8211; so we have to wait until the next tick of install growth (up or down) to get any idea &#8211; it&#8217;s not reasonable &#8211; this can take 6 months or more in some cases, and literally forever if your plugin is neither going up or down in active installs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Participants in the discussion on trac were so inflamed that one suggested plugin developers should strike by offering no more support, updates, or new plugins to the directory unless WordPress brings back the growth charts. This simply isn&#8217;t possible for the many people who make a living from their plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As someone who is in the early days of trying to grow a freemium plugin, I&#8217;m incredibly frustrated,&#8221; Equalize Digital CEO Amber Hinds <a href=\"https://twitter.com/heyamberhinds/status/1577651286970929159\">said</a>. &#8220;We were using that as one way to gauge the efficacy of our marketing efforts and now it&#8217;s just gone. Also, in investor conversations being able to show growth is vital.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>George Stephanis, an Automattic employee who was not involved in the decision, <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511#comment:60\">claims</a> that, &#8220;This chart was removed&nbsp;due to a Security or Privacy concern,&#8221; and speculates that it hasn&#8217;t been disclosed yet because it can&#8217;t be shared without putting users at risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It was never explicitly stated it was removed for a security or privacy concern,&#8221; Earle Davies <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511#comment:61\">said</a> in response to this claim. &#8220;It was removed due to &#8216;due to insufficient data obfuscation&#8217; which to me does not mean security or privacy. Privacy is PII which this chart did not include. The obfuscation is because &#8216;we&#8217; (whoever we is) did not want people to be able to see &#8216;exact&#8217; stats. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Framing a summation of this as a privacy or security update isn&#8217;t accurate. What may be most useful is if Matt stops flying by with 1-2 sentence non-answers and finally addresses in detail and plain language WHY this was removed. Short of that it should be reinstated ASAP and work on better charts in the future.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress plugin developers may never know the details behind this chart&#8217;s removal. If it is in fact a security issue, this could have been confirmed in a transparent way by the people involved. Instead, plugin developers have been set on edge by the demand that they present their side of the argument for bringing back the stats. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mark Zahra, the author of the ticket to bring the stats back, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markzahra/status/1577599271045586949\">tweeted</a> to bring attention to how many people are following the ticket and invested in its outcome. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Even if 10,000 people commented and appeared to agree that would still be a small fraction of the wider WP community,&#8221; Mullenweg <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1577739784453124096\">responded</a>. &#8220;That’s one of the hardest things to navigate in open source, and product and community development generally.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This reaction drew the ire and frustration of those hoping for some real answers. It also makes it exquisitely clear who has the power in this situation, whether to withhold information or turn off access to data. Despite overwhelming consensus on the ticket from the people impacted the most by this decision, 10,000 wouldn&#8217;t be enough to wield any influence over the outcome. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, the protracted lack of transparency in this matter has further damaged trust in WordPress.org as the best distribution channel for free plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The way that this has been dealt with has made me seriously question if WordPress is the right platform for me, for the first time in years &#8211; it&#8217;s made me and my business feel vulnerable,&#8221; Morsali said.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 06 Oct 2022 04:13:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"WPTavern: #45 – Alex Ball on Customizing Core Blocks for Clients\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://wptavern.com/?post_type=podcast&p=138304\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/45-alex-ball-on-customizing-core-blocks-for-clients\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:38261:\"Transcript<div>\n<p>[00:00:00] Nathan Wrigley: Welcome to the Jukebox podcast from WP Tavern.

And that, in essence is the subject of the podcast today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During WordCamp US 2022, Alex gave a lightning talk in which he laid out some suggestions on how the block editor can be made more straightforward for clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most regular WordPress users have become accustomed to the way that the block editor works. Over time, we&#8217;ve understood how things work and where we need to go in the UI to alter things. For many clients, this familiarity simply does not exist. The editor is new and perhaps confusing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the block editor is under constant revision, this can create confusion, and lead to mistakes. Add to that the fact that more and more of the website can now be modified inside the editor, and it&#8217;s easy to see how mistakes can be made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex talks about solutions to this problem, and he comes at it from different angles. Maybe you lock certain features down so that only certain users can achieve specific tasks. Or it might be that you need to take some time to educate your clients more about the block editor and how it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically when we record the podcast, there&#8217;s not a lot of background noise, but that&#8217;s not always the case. Over the coming weeks, I&#8217;ll be bringing you recordings from a recent trip to WordCamp US 2022, and you might notice that the recordings have a little echo or other strange audio artifacts. Whilst the podcasts are more than listable, I hope that you understand that the vagaries of the real world were at play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all the links in the show notes by heading over to WP tavern.com. Forward slash podcast. And you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes there as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you, Alex Ball.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by Alex Ball. How are you doing, Alex?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:07] Alex Ball: Very well, thank you for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:09] Nathan Wrigley: We are at WordCamp US 2022. We&#8217;re sitting in the media room, and Alex has joined me today to have a little bit of conversation about block patterns and blocks and locking blocks and all of those kind of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll get into that in a moment, but Alex, just give us a little bit of background. Tell us about yourself, your journey with WordPress. How is it that you&#8217;re at a WordCamp, talking to a bunch of people in your presentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:31] Alex Ball: Sure. So I started with WordPress probably in 2007 or so. And at that point I was not a developer, I was an English major. I had been on the editorial staff of our city magazine in Baltimore, Baltimore Magazine for seven years, and people knew what the internet was at that time and we didn&#8217;t have a very good site and we needed one. And I somehow talked leadership into letting me take over the site without any of that development experience that was probably critical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, I dove right in and got used to it and followed some tutorials for building a WordPress theme from scratch, and just took off from there. So I, I was there for another four years. I worked at another company that had quite a few websites, both internal and external.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they were across a number of different states in the US, and so working with those, using WordPress on quite a few of them. Landing pages, some internal intranet type things. And then I found Mind Grub, and I&#8217;ve been with Mind Grub for three and a half years, and we do all sorts of things from really large enterprise scale things hosted on WordPress VIP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We do headless installations with a React single page app front end. We do more structured data sort of things where Gutenberg is really not a consideration because of all the structured data that&#8217;s going on there. And we have a pretty excellent WordPress team, and so it&#8217;s been really beneficial for me to try to carve out that path within our team and help us move forward with Gutenberg because we&#8217;ve heard from Matt Mullenweg more than once that Gutenberg is the future of WordPress. That you&#8217;re going to need to know JavaScript to work with WordPress in depth, and that when people ask him at WordCamp about the sites that they still have with the classic editor plugin running, and what they need to do about that and when they&#8217;ll need to switch those over, he says you&#8217;re going to need to switch those over at some point,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:02] Nathan Wrigley: At Mind Grub, is that a decision that you made more recently, or are we going back several years? You&#8217;re exclusively using Gutenberg with a variety of different blocks?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:11] Alex Ball: We are, no, I would not say we&#8217;re exclusively using Gutenberg. It still depends on the site, and we still do raise the prospect of it with a client at the beginning of a project. We find that some clients are aware of it, and really don&#8217;t want to use it. We&#8217;ve had that reaction so we just go with that and we use the classic editor plugin and we move on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have found that most of the time they&#8217;re not familiar with it, and so they don&#8217;t care one way or another. And when we tell them it&#8217;s a more enhanced, what you see is what you get editing experience with more ability to move things around and know what you&#8217;re doing before you hit save, that they like the sound of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We occasionally have people who say that they&#8217;ve heard of it and do want to use it. And I guess those are the three real possibilities there. So, in large part it is we&#8217;re moving forward with it and doing that because we know it&#8217;s the future, it&#8217;s going to be better for the client and they do not have a strong preference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:20] Nathan Wrigley: So you are here and you are giving a presentation. I say giving, maybe you&#8217;ve already given.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:25] Alex Ball: I have given it, yes. It was about an hour ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:28] Nathan Wrigley: How did it go?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:29] Alex Ball: I thought it went well. It was a lightning talk and it was about modifying or customizing core blocks for clients. And I used a metaphor about setting guardrails for clients, that I believe was also recently spoken on your podcast with another guest who used the same phrase, and I heard that one after I had made my submission. But I thought it went well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a lightning talk and so it was really focused on the nitty gritty of using a few blocks as examples, core blocks that are probably the most used blocks. Heading, paragraph, image, button, and talking about the specific options that they present for modifying their output and their appearance. And how to go about doing that. And in some cases it was using PHP to do some things. In some cases it&#8217;s enqueuing some admin scripts. And in a lot of the cases it&#8217;s using the theme dot json file, which not everyone is totally familiar with at this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:41] Nathan Wrigley: Okay, so it was called customizing core blocks for clients. And forgive me, I was not present at your talk, I may be ill prepared with this question, but it felt from the show notes that you shared with me, the things that you thought it would be good to talk about. The principle of the talk was how to lock things down in a website, so that you could build things and then be fairly sure that when you hand it over, there&#8217;s not gonna be that moment where they phone you 24 hours later to say, it no longer looks the same. We&#8217;ve had a bit of a play. We thought we knew what we were doing, and sadly we need you to fix what we just broke. That&#8217;s the principle, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:20] Alex Ball: Right, Exactly. And you find that the nice thing about working with WordPress is that someone on the client team, when you start the project is already familiar with it. Someone has worked with WordPress in the past. Maybe the site that they&#8217;re replacing is a WordPress site. So they&#8217;re somewhat familiar with it, even if they&#8217;re not familiar with the block editor yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And before I even get into developing and writing the theme, there&#8217;s already been a large process with our design and UX teams designing the site, and those stakeholders, the client, are sitting in these meetings reviewing those designs, exploring design ideas early on to establish things that they like and don&#8217;t like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of time spent on that design, and there&#8217;s a lot of thought that goes into it. From a design perspective, the colors that they choose to compliment one another, the fonts that they choose, the UX decisions for what type of menu it might be, how this might look with this. And so all of that work is being done, and the client is obviously paying for that. So it&#8217;s important to make sure that that is consistent throughout the development process and after you&#8217;ve handed the site off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully when we do a project, we are creating a relationship with this client and not just simply handing over a site and waving goodbye to them. So, it&#8217;s important to make sure that they feel like they have the control that they need to do what they want to do on the site, but not to feel like anything they touch is going to break something or look bad or go way outside the bounds of this design system that has been carefully crafted for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:14] Nathan Wrigley: I&#8217;m pretty sure that 99% of the people listening to this podcast will know exactly what the Gutenberg UI looks like. They can drop paragraph blocks in and they can drop various other bits and pieces in. But in your presentation, the summary of your presentation, you make this point, which is borrowed from somewhere else, I&#8217;m sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you said with great power comes great responsibility. And I guess if you were back in the days of the what we&#8217;re now calling the classic editor, you really didn&#8217;t have any options there. You were just pasting text. There might be some shortcodes being dumped in. And now of course in the era of Gutenberg, there&#8217;s a whole load of things that every single person dropping into a default install of WordPress can change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, there&#8217;s options to change the color of the text, and there&#8217;s options to increase the padding and the margins, and a whole myriad of things in the right hand column. And I guess this is the piece. You&#8217;re trying to make it so that there are constraints in what the clients can alter in the Gutenberg UI?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:15] Alex Ball: Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:16] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. You also have called your presentation, well you use the phrase customizing core blocks. Why just core blocks?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:24] Alex Ball: Well, the reason I went with core blocks is because they&#8217;re obviously present in WordPress at this point, and there&#8217;s no extra work to be done. Everyone has probably seen them in WordPress, even if you have decided to go a different route and install a plugin that gives you some other blocks that you feel you might want some sort of carousel or gallery or something like that, that you like the look of or does what you needed to do. You&#8217;ve still got those core blocks there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So everyone is working with those, that&#8217;s a sort of common denominator. And also because when we talk about being as efficient as possible when building this site and giving the client as much of what they want as we can give them. It makes more sense to start with those core blocks, which are already there. We don&#8217;t have to do any extra work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don&#8217;t have to waste any other time either creating a custom block that&#8217;s essentially reinventing the wheel. They are there, and if there are good ways, and not necessarily easy, but ways to customize them, that makes the most sense for getting these things off the ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:41] Nathan Wrigley: If we go back several years, it feels like it&#8217;s quite a long time now, when Gutenberg initially launched, there was a real kind of schism in the community. Many people felt that it wasn&#8217;t fit for purpose at that time. You know, there were limited options. It was all very confusing and so on. I feel like we&#8217;ve crossed that Rubicon now. We&#8217;ve come to the other side and, most people here are familiar with it and working with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, the reason that these third party plugins come along, which drop in the carousel and drop in the accordion and all the other different things, is because there are some fairly big limitations to what core blocks can do. You know, there aren&#8217;t all of the different options and those third party suites are there to fill in that gap. What are your feelings about your ability to create almost any layout with core blocks? Is that now possible?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:30] Alex Ball: Whew. My gut is telling me no. And I think that this was part of that recent controversy that I&#8217;m sort of surface familiar with, where they released a new design on the wordpress.org site for the homepage and the downloads page. And again, referring to something that Matt Mullenweg said, he talked about how it could have been done more quickly than it was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he also referred to like Wix and Squarespace and page builders. And it generated obviously a lot of feedback. I think some people were in agreement, and others did not agree. I think that a lot of the sentiment out there was that you could still, with the core blocks available to you, not necessarily go ahead and just do this as easily as people were making it seem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that I had seen something on WP Tavern about a YouTuber who is very, very good with the block editor, and like whipped through in one of his videos, the building that homepage design through the block editor alone, and feeling like he got 95% of the way there pretty quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, speaking to what I&#8217;m most familiar with, which is our projects and the designs that we put together. There has not been a project in the last couple years where we have come up with designs for it and been able to do even more than half of it with just core blocks. I do like to use the core blocks as much as possible for the reasons that we already discussed, but it usually involves quite a bit of custom work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, our designers also know that, and they&#8217;re certainly designing for things. There&#8217;s always that interplay of design and development, and getting a design and explaining why something is a little difficult or might not work with this or that, and going back and forth and collaborating. The main thing I think is that the core blocks have a lot of these options and it&#8217;s sort of like, I think it was the Abraham Lincoln quote, which is, you can please all of the people some of the time, or you can please some of the people all of the time, but you can&#8217;t please all of the people all of the time. And so it just can&#8217;t be all things to all people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:02] Nathan Wrigley: I guess the nice thing about Gutenberg blocks is that they nest. You can put in a block and then inside of that, let&#8217;s say, I don&#8217;t know, it might be a group block or something like that, and then you can nest things. And one of the nested items could be a core block, and then you are going to unlock the ability to modify that core block. Let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s a paragraph block or a heading block or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it may be that you&#8217;re doing custom work with the parent blocks, but the bit that you are trying to open up to the client, if you like, may just be a core block, which is a child of that. Have I kind of got where you were describing there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:40] Alex Ball: Yes, that&#8217;s exactly right. And that inner blocks element that you can use either if you&#8217;re building a custom block in React, or if you decide to go the route, we tend to use ACF on a lot of sites, and ACF has a very easy method for creating blocks as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you&#8217;re not constrained to just using ACF fields on those. You can use that inner blocks element in an ACF block to include a core block or core blocks. And we&#8217;ve definitely done that because again, sometimes you have a core container block, like a columns block that&#8217;s going to give the user a slider that lets them choose the number of columns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we don&#8217;t necessarily want that. I wanna use the paragraph block within that, but I don&#8217;t want the ability to slide that thing all the way to the right and, insert a six column layout, because that&#8217;s not gonna look good anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think that you nailed it. I think that there is always that combination of some of that custom work, and some of the core blocks that we&#8217;ve already got that make it easier to bootstrap things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:55] Nathan Wrigley: I have a feeling that if we were to have this conversation, I&#8217;m gonna say 24 months. I think if we had the same conversation in 24 months, I&#8217;m imagining that some of the things that you can not achieve at the moment with core blocks, that will have gone, and the layout will be almost entirely possible with core blocks. I certainly know that that&#8217;s the intention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re not quite there yet, but some third party things, I&#8217;m thinking of things like GenerateBlocks and so on at the moment. They&#8217;ve really got the whole, the grid layout and all of that really well defined and sussed out. And I just think it&#8217;s a matter of time, so maybe it would be a moot point in 24 months and we might just be able to skip over that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:32] Alex Ball: I think that you&#8217;re right. I agree with that. I don&#8217;t know if there is an equivalent to Moore&#8217;s law about, you know, how quickly Gutenberg is going to double or whatever to make itself kind of the next version of it. I know that they, well, I think that they think of it in phases. And this imminent third phase, whether it&#8217;s already begun or it&#8217;s about to begin, I&#8217;m not sure, but that&#8217;s sort of the workflow phase, and the emphasis is going to be on collaboration, I believe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then after that I think there&#8217;s a roadmap for looking at things like multilingual stuff. So, your framing it like that, looking at it in the future, and some of these issues we&#8217;re talking about today, being obsolete at that point is correct. And I think is hopefully captured by that phased approach that they are talking about</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:27] Nathan Wrigley: In your presentation notes, you mentioned that you are essentially, you are handing over your work to clients. They&#8217;ve paid for their website and you want to mitigate them and you use the word breaking or break. Are the tools for allowing clients to modify this thing, but not this thing. Do they exist in core already? Can you deploy those things or is that custom work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:52] Alex Ball: The answer to that is a hearty, confident, it depends. It would be really nice to be able to get very granular with some of these things and let different roles control different things. There is a little bit of that now. We&#8217;re starting to scratch the surface with that, as I understand it. Since version six, we&#8217;ve got this block locking feature. Now to clarify, before version six, you have the ability to set a template and use that template lock attribute to determine whether the entire template that you&#8217;ve defined is locked down and nothing can be added or moved around, or whether things could be moved within it. That existed already.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now what we&#8217;ve got is on the block settings itself, a little lock icon and the ability to do those same things with that block. I wanna lock this block so it can&#8217;t be moved. I want to lock this block so it can&#8217;t be removed. I wanna do both. You can do both of those things now and, I think it is the can lock attribute. I may be wrong on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s an attribute that will let you specify whether a user, based on their role, is able to access that lock setting. Now, that lock setting itself is a little bit rudimentary. We&#8217;re talking about this and we&#8217;re going, Oh man, so only administrators can add the drop cap. We&#8217;re not there yet, as far as I know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:27] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. I think at the moment it&#8217;s a case of, and I could be wrong about this, maybe things have moved on. I think it&#8217;s merely a function to lock it for now. It is locked, but I think almost anybody can go and unlock it. The principle, I think, is to lock it just so you don&#8217;t accidentally do something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I feel that the things that you&#8217;ve described, that&#8217;s a real nice roadmap, isn&#8217;t it? The ability to be able to lock things in the UI based upon roles. Who knows, even based upon particular users. And so, almost everything comes into play. So as an example, you are an editor, you can do anything more or less, you know, we&#8217;ve given you real wide scope to move things up and down, change the colors, change the font, change the text, whatever, depending on which block you&#8217;re using.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you are a different role. Created a new role for some other person in the organization, and all that they can do is move things up and down. Just that, there&#8217;s no other capabilities. And I feel that all of that is going to come and we&#8217;ll be able to lock people in and out. And at the moment, as you said, it&#8217;s all possible if you are a developer, but the day will come, I&#8217;m hoping that that&#8217;s all possible by non-technical users with the necessary permissions to do that in some kind of UI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:39] Alex Ball: Yeah exactly. I feel the same way. And in my talk there&#8217;s a bit of a constraint with time. And so I think it comes off a little bit as feeling like I&#8217;m referring to this sort of monolithic, the client, as this singular entity and it&#8217;s the same everywhere. And obviously it&#8217;s not. Every site is different, every client is different, every client team is different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But even beyond that, you could be talking about situations where you had your stakeholders during the project. They loved the designs. They understand what they&#8217;re getting. They understand how to use it. They understand what sort of control they have when they are adding blocks and creating content. And then you have a relationship with them and maybe a maintenance agreement or something, and six months later, they&#8217;ve hired someone new, who was not present to hear about why the designers chose this over this. To hear the rationale behind choosing these button styles over these button styles, and getting all of that background on the design and why it works so well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But they do have some assignment to add a CTA to the website, by tomorrow. And they want it to stand out. And the controls are right there on this button block to choose any color they want for the text and any color they want for the background. And they go ahead and do that. And then you hear from the supervisor, the person that you&#8217;ve been working with, who says, we establish this color palette. How were we able to go so far outside that with hot pink. And also, this person didn&#8217;t choose an accessible contrast ratio between the button text and the button background colors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can imagine all these different situations where even though you accounted for some of these things, and even though there was a bit of that uncertainty and agreement with the client that you can do this, but you shouldn&#8217;t. There are still situations that maybe you didn&#8217;t account for that will allow them to go outside the bounds of what was really intended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the counter argument, I suppose, is probably it is their website, and they did pay for all this and it&#8217;s theirs. And if they decide they wanna do that, they can. And I guess the only real response to that is that that is fine. It is your site and we&#8217;re happy to help you with it. But when you run into these issues that occur because of all that control and your willingness to change these things, then there&#8217;s only so much we can do. And if you decide that you want us at that point to put some limitations on there, then we will be happy to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:32] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, there really is no perfect answer to this question is there? There is just what that particular client is willing to negotiate. And it may be that a particular client just wants nothing to do with it and wants to write you email. Every time they want to make a modification, the email comes in and you do it. So they don&#8217;t need any permissions of any kind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are gonna be the others who are gonna want everything available to them and potentially do a wonderful job, but potentially really be on the phone a lot, asking you to fix things. And I guess there&#8217;s a job of figuring out the contracts, and working out, okay, if I give you this permission, that&#8217;s fine, but, I don&#8217;t know, here&#8217;s our hourly rate when things go pear shaped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:13] Alex Ball: Yes. and we are not the HOA president who is out here to walk the neighborhood and point out the mortar color in their bricks, that is not an HOA approved mortar color. That&#8217;s not us. So I would go back to what I said before where it&#8217;s, I hope we are establishing a relationship with the client and that part of that is that collaborative nature and that understanding with them of what they&#8217;re getting and what can be done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we do tend to have projects regularly where there is training with the client built in, and that is really helpful. Because we&#8217;re able to do a walkthrough with them and explain these things, and have them point out things that maybe they&#8217;ve already been in there doing content management, and we&#8217;re running into something with this or that. And then we&#8217;re also able to provide them with documentation that they can continue to refer to. And that is obviously a great opportunity to discuss all of these things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:14] Nathan Wrigley: How granular have you gone with this in the past? Have you handed over websites where there&#8217;s been literally dozens of users or user roles where they&#8217;ve got, this particular user role can do these myriad of things and this other user role can just do far less? Have you really explored this a lot and found it to be fruitful?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:31] Alex Ball: I wouldn&#8217;t say that we have had, or at least that come to my mind right now, too many sites where we have many, many different user roles. You certainly run into sites where there needs to be some sort of editorial workflow and approval process. And I think that that, for the most part, handles those sorts of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I also think that, where we are right now with the block editor, in the future we are more likely to be able to handle some of these things on a role by role basis. Whereas right now it is a little bit more difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:12] Nathan Wrigley: You mentioned training and that&#8217;s a big part. How to describe it? I think it can be quite a tiresome thing to create the training because, on some level you just want the website to be finished and you want to hand it over. But I guess if you are handing over a website based on Gutenberg, and the clients have never seen this before. Creating training materials, being on hand, going to their premises and demonstrating it to them, or creating videos and putting those somewhere. I guess that&#8217;s an important part in this puzzle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:39] Alex Ball: Yes, yes. We tend to record those training sessions, those, uh, Zoom calls where we&#8217;re walking through it and screen sharing. And we did recently go through the documentation, that sort of, starter framework of that documentation, and revise it and go through some of the things that we&#8217;ve got in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then obviously every site gets a few different, not even appendices, but main sections. There&#8217;s a table of contents and you go through some of the basics of WordPress, but then you delve into some of those custom blocks and sometimes they really need some extra documentation over exactly what each feature does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, you&#8217;ve got the different fields labeled and you&#8217;ve got descriptions on those labels. But it really helps them to have that documentation to refer to as well, explaining why this happens. Why when I click this, this other conditional field disappears. And it&#8217;s because if you do it this way, you&#8217;re not going to have access to this or vice versa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The documentation and the training is not part of every project, but when it is, a lot of the things that we&#8217;ve talked about can come up and be worked through, and for the most part solved, or at least established what lines are where.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:04] Nathan Wrigley: You mentioned at the beginning that you weren&#8217;t a developer. You&#8217;ve sort of grown into that role. And I imagine there&#8217;s several people listening to this who have played with blocks in the UI. They&#8217;ve dragged things in and they&#8217;ve modified what&#8217;s available to them there and, that&#8217;s great. But if they want to start tinkering with blocks and they want to alter what the capabilities are with the blocks, the core blocks, whichever block it may be. What are the kind of things that they need to be interested in? Where do they need to be going? What are the documents that they need to read? What are the technologies they need to understand?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:35] Alex Ball: That&#8217;s a very good question. I, a few years ago at WordCamp, did another talk where I talked about coding like a writer, and it was trying to give those non-technical content people more confidence in diving into the code a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it&#8217;s modifying the attributes on a short code. You know, you&#8217;ve cut and pasted from documentation from the plugin that provides that short code. But you&#8217;re starting to look at that and realize that these different little attributes within those brackets do different things. And what happens if I do this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Delving into the html behind the scenes a little bit. Getting your feet wet and all that. And I used principles that you would adhere to in writing and also try to adhere to in coding, to get them to feel more comfortable doing what I think you were describing, which is getting into that code a little bit and not simply staying on the surface with just the UI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was things like don&#8217;t repeat yourself, which is obviously a massively important axiom in engineering. It was things like, get to the point as quickly as possible. It was things like writing good documentation. Commenting the things that you are adding to the code so that other people know what it means.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the closest thing to that sort of pure editorial writing that I touched on. And, so I think that hopefully people felt a little bit empowered by that to go, Oh, okay, well, right. So this is the way I would approach the lead in my story. And so this is how I&#8217;m going to approach the template on this page or the way I structure these blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:33] Nathan Wrigley: When you began your work on blocks, were there any places that you found to be particularly useful that helped you understand the technologies behind? Because it is a big, it is a big change. If you&#8217;ve been working with PHP for the last 20 years, not really wanted to stray away from there, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a lot to be learned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m imagining that you&#8217;ve found better places than others, shall we say. What are some of the resources that you have enjoyed using that you would recommend to others, should they be interested in this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:00] Alex Ball: The first one that comes to mind that I think I hit on pretty regularly as I was learning was Bill Erickson&#8217;s website. He&#8217;s got a lot of good information and it appears pretty high up in most Google results. So it shouldn&#8217;t be too difficult to suss out his information on it. But obviously going to his site and looking through things tagged as Gutenberg should do the trick as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, and I mean obviously Stack Overflow, so much information on there. There is a trainer online named Zach Gordon, who does a lot of JavaScript based training, which is what you&#8217;re going to need to deal with, if you are starting to create those custom blocks and you&#8217;re not going to use some sort of scaffolding or use that Advanced Custom Fields approach to building them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember using one of his courses to dive into some of that and get a lot of good information from him. And, along the way we started modifying that starter theme that we use for projects to make it easier to build it into a, a block theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:14] Nathan Wrigley: Alex Ball, thank you so much for joining us on the podcast today. It&#8217;s been a real pleasure chatting to you about blocks and locking them down and so on and so forth. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:22] Alex Ball: No, thank you. It has been my pleasure.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have Alex Ball.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex is a Lead Software Engineer at <a href=\"https://www.mindgrub.com/\">Mindgrub</a>, a digital agency in Baltimore, Maryland. He’s been there for over three years, during which he’s worked on headless implementations, multinational multisite installations, and much more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to joining Mindgrub, Alex worked in-house for a company handling a suite of internal intranet-type sites and external marketing lead-generation sites. He spent seven years at Baltimore magazine on the editorial staff before managing their website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His website leadership experience continues to inform his decision-making today, especially for training clients and making the block editor as easy to use as possible, and that, in essence, is the subject of the podcast today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During WordCamp US 2022, Alex gave a lightning talk in which he laid out some suggestions on how the block editor can be made more straightforward for clients. Most regular WordPress users have become accustomed to the way the block editor works. Over time, we’ve understood how things work and where we need to go in the UI to alter things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many clients, this familiarity simply does not exist. The editor is new and perhaps confusing. As the block editor is under constant revision, this can create confusion and lead to mistakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add to that the fact that more and more of the website can now be modified inside the editor, and it’s easy to see how mistakes can be made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex talks about solutions to this problem, and he comes at it from different angles. Maybe you lock certain features down so that only certain users can achieve specific tasks. Or it might be that you need to take time to educate your clients more about the block editor and how it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, when we record the podcast, there’s not a lot of background noise, but that’s not always the case. Over the coming weeks, I’ll be bringing you recordings from a recent trip to WordCamp US 2022, and you might notice that the recordings have a little echo or other strange audio artefacts. Whilst the podcasts are more than listenable, I hope you understand that the vagaries of the real world were at play.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2019/session/code-like-a-writer/\">Code like a writer</a> &#8211; Alex&#8217;s talk at WordCamp US 2019</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.billerickson.net/\">Bill Erickson&#8217;s website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/blocks/\">ACF Blocks</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wp.zacgordon.com/courses/\">Zac Gordon&#8217;s courses</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Oct 2022 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"Do The Woo Community: devlife_snippet: Partnership &gt; First Win &gt;Talk About It\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=73012\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://dothewoo.io/partnership-first-win-talk-about-it/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:440:\"<p>A lot of founders constantly struggle with WooCommerce and WordPress product growth.

This release also improves selection of multiple blocks, making it smoother and more consistent. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most impactful improvements to the writing flow is that the editor now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/44083\">hides all floating block UI</a> while the user is typing. Gutenberg engineer Michal Czaplinski demonstrated these updates in a video:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Version 14.2 adds support for kerning controls in the Global Styles panel, making it possible for users to adjust the letter spacing with live preview in the editor. Gutenberg contributor Robert Anderson, who submitted the PR for this feature, advocated for getting it into the upcoming 6.1 release. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t technically a &#8216;bug&#8217; (more &#8216;missing functionality&#8217;) but it (along with <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/44067\">#44067</a>) does make global styles feel less broken,&#8221; Anderson said. 15 days ago the feature was cherry-picked and added to the wp/6.1 branch to have it included in the next release.</p>\n\n\n\nvideo source: Gutenberg <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/44142#pullrequestreview-1108485369\">PR #44142</a>\n\n\n\n<p>A few other notable improvements in version 14.2 include the following: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>New Calendar block settings for adding the background, link, and text color</li>\n\n\n\n<li>“Banners” and “Footers” added to block pattern categories</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Autocompletion for links is now available in any block using the <code>[[</code> shortcut to trigger it in the editor</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg developers also discovered that they recently introduced a bug when improving the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/09/01/whats-new-in-gutenberg-14-0-31-august/#highlight-1\">List block to use inner blocks</a>, where it would re-render for each level of nesting. Fixing this problem brought significant performance gains for the initial load of the editor.

Challenges arose with reliable project management on the agency side while they tried to establish a foothold in the WordPress plugin market after a first attempt with themes. The WooCommerce Extensions Store is where their business took off. With niche extensions that had no competition, they ranked very quickly. Other ideas for plugins solved problems in custom development projects for clients. Eventually, the Keiths developed a formula for evaluating new plugin ideas. Learn from their challenges and successes — there are a lot of interesting details that only come from experience.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-35 wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-34 wp-block-columns sponsor has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\" id=\"StellarWP\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-32 wp-block-column\">\n<h3 class=\"StellarWP has-theme-palette-1-color has-text-color\" id=\"Sponsor\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f64f.png\" alt=\"🙏\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Sponsor: <span><a href=\"https://poststat.us/elementor\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow\">Elementor</a></span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elementor </strong>enables web creators to build professional, pixel-perfect websites with an intuitive visual builder.

I\'m talking to one of our great post status members, Katie. Keith. I got to meet her in person a couple weeks ago at work camp US in San Diego, and got a little bit about her story there and she\'s got so many compelling things to part of her story that\'s gonna be valuable to our audience and our membership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, particularly how do you go from client service and agency? To successful plug-in business, particularly, you\'re gonna hear all those stories about, um, Katie and her work and her team\'s work at Barn two. But Katie, thank you for, um, coming on, uh, post draft today and being willing to share your story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Thank you for having me. Okay, so tell us a little bit about yourself. You\'re the co-founder of Barn Two, but I want to give you an opportunity to just kinda say a little bit about yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Um, yeah, so I\'m Katie. Um, kind of one of the two directors at Barn, two plugins. I run [00:01:00] the company with my husband Andy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, we\'re English, but last year we moved to, uh, New Yorker, Spain, um, because of the flexibility you get with this industry, which is amazing. Um, So that\'s kind of what\'s new with me at the moment and new country to live in. And we have a kind of a team around the world. So, um, we were able to work from anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> awesome. Um, and we could talk about New York all the time cause I remember you mentioned that and I love that, uh, story. But I\'m gonna stay the topic here today. Well, so tell us about, Okay. Currently today, um, Your business is primarily around plugins, but WooCommerce plugins, and I wanna get to that, but I wanna talk about the story of the beginning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, mm-hmm. , you, you and your husband started in 2009, but could you tell us the story about how you started in web design and development and WordPress and all that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Yeah, sure. So, um, Most of the [00:02:00] time when in, when we were in our twenties, we had normal jobs, um, both in the public sector in England, and we would always talk about we wanting to run a business together and we never did it for ages and ages and, um, just kept taking our salaries and not doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then eventually, um, Andy in particular was, um, quite fed up with his job and so we thought, Right, we\'re gonna take the plunge and do something. And we couldn\'t afford for us both to do it. So he quit his job and I kept my job and we started freelancing together, basically building websites. Uh, we thought that was a fairly easy thing to get into because, um, you can attract quite small clients and work your way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, um, he\'s a software developer and did the technical stuff and I have a marketing and project management background, so I managed the clients and did their SEO and content and everything. So it worked quite well as, um, something we could do together. So we started freelancing, um, fairly quickly. We [00:03:00] discovered WordPress as being the best way to build a website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So all our projects were built on WordPress. Um, it wasn\'t something the clients were asking for, that was just our decision. And then after about a year, I thought, Well, what if I actually advertised this as WordPress specialists? So this was in late 2010. So I ran a Google AdWords campaign focusing on keywords like WordPress experts and things like that, and it was amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We. I think I spent 3000, uh, probably pounds, and we got within couple of weeks, more than 10,000 pounds worth of work out of it. I realized it\'s not that easy now because there\'s a lot of WordPress specialists, but back then there was a gap that we kind of fell on, and so the agency grew from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Okay, so then you\'re, and then you were able to come full time at some point, of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, uh, what, what happened? So you, you found WordPress, you started to build this, and how did the next [00:04:00] couple of months, years or whatever until, um, the plugins go, what were you, you were just, you were building websites and all the things around it. Did it get, did it broaden out to anything specialization wise, or?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How did that grow? Grow from there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Yeah, we specialized in doing more bespoke, uh, client projects in WordPress because we\'d found this gap that there was at the time. And we recruited a team of freelancers, um, from websites like Upwork, which wasn\'t called Upwork then, and people per hour and found good people and, you know, we thoroughly vet them and things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we managed to build a freelance team. We didn\'t have any employees or anything. Everybody was just freelance. And that way we could increase capacity. We were really pleased at first that we were running our own business. We quit our jobs, and that was really great. And then we started to think, actually, it\'s still kind of not the perfect lifestyle because clients work, [00:05:00] as I\'m sure all your listeners know, can be quite demanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They want things done straight away. They have problems with their website, which you have to sort out immediately and you don\'t really get any time. So we have that in the back of our minds that what is the ultimate sort of lifestyle type business where we can be successful and have that flexibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And being in the WordPress industry, we could see that WordPress products and the growth of that. And, um, at the time you could see how well people were doing with themes, particularly, um, on theme forest. So in about 2013 we spent like literally a year building a theme, which we were gonna spend on sell on theme forest, and it was rejected, so that was disappointing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, we spent so long building this product that in the time we were doing so that market changed and it became very competitive with the big themes like Avada and Jupiter coming out, uh, which were huge [00:06:00] pieces of software, uh, with tons and tons of features, which we. Possibly do, um, ourselves. So we kind of gave up on that idea for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and then in, but in 2016, we thought, let\'s go down the plugin route because plugins can be small and very niche, or do I have to say niche, um, . Um, and so we launched our first plugin, um, and um, it went from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Okay, so let\'s back up just a second. So, started themes, what was the, was the desire there to kind of diversify income, explore this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you have, you obviously had some time to be able to, like your, your agency work is going well and start to, Okay. Hey, how, how did the product and the themes, uh, idea kind of get started and, and what were your thoughts around that? Like,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> We found the capacity to develop it, um, through the freelance team so that [00:07:00] they didn\'t do the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, they did the client projects and that freed up Andy as the technical director to work on the side projects. So because we had people that we could outsource the technical side of projects, Two, he was able to do that. And then I was able to take over the marketing when things were launched. And so that was, um, if it was just him doing all the client projects, that would\'ve been very difficult because he, you get dragged onto those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, whenever something urgent happens or he, you need some money, then you\'d end up doing the work yourself. So through the, um, freelance team, that was helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I feel like I hear a lot of stories where it\'s, you get up to kind of cruising that altitude and you\'re able to have just a little bit more time and space to go, Huh?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What else would we like to do? Um, you mentioned lifestyle in a second ago, but what was the spark that goes, Okay, maybe if this is true, we had one more time in space where [00:08:00] Andy, for instance, in this scenario, Do that more. What was the spark that led to that? That initial theme product? The</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> spark was that we reached a ceiling in the growth that we were realistically able to achieve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we had taken on a lot more risk and full-time staff and gone down a much more traditional company model, then we could have continued to grow. But basically the limit we faced was project management. So we found good people that could do design websites and plugins for us, for our clients more specifically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but whenever we tried to find project managers, it didn\'t work. And I spent a long time training some freelance project managers and they just didn\'t have the WordPress experience, the relationship with the clients as I did in. Managing myself. Um, so, and the clients were less happy. Um, and one time [00:09:00] in 2015, um, it, our daughter was just about to start school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as you will know, that holidays get very expensive when your child\'s at school. So before that, we decided to take a month off. And we hired a motor home and drove around France for a month, and that meant we had to take a step back from work. And I got one of my project managers to handle everything, and it was a disaster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The clients were unhappy, projects failed. It just didn\'t work. And it became clear that that was the ceiling I had to manage all the project. Um, I obviously didn\'t have the skills to recruit and train project managers. I know some people are good at that, but I wasn\'t. And, um, so we couldn\'t grow any further because I couldn\'t manage any additional projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so then we started thinking, how can we grow, uh, products?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I see. I, I love how you described it as ceiling, cuz I can totally see that, you know, you get to a point where, kind of a fourth in road too of what do you, [00:10:00] what do you wanna do? And we feel like we\'re right here. So that\'s, that\'s, that\'s inspiring too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, okay, so we had the same product and that didn\'t go well. We, you sp said you spent about a year doing that. Um, and then we get over to plugins. I think you said two. 16. But I, I hear from a lot of, um, agencies that have transitioned or offer products that often they start as, uh, client work and you go, Oh, it\'s a discovery of there\'s a need here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how did the plugins and I wanna talk about, and actually talk about what the plugins are, but how did that, uh, spark get started there too with the plugin?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Um, well, we launched two plugins very early on. One of them we got the idea from the WooCommerce Ideas forum, where you can publicly see where the gaps in the market are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we just went through the list by the number of votes and found the idea that was, had the most votes. That was realistic for us to develop. So, um, that was our first [00:11:00] plugin, which was called WooCommerce, Password Protected Categories. So it was very simple. It loads of people wanted it, there was nothing at the time that did it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it just lets you password protected category for your store. Like if you wanna create a, a hidden area in your shop for members or wholesalers or. So we launched that and our other initial plugin, we got the idea from a client. So this client, uh, hired us to create a searchable table for his blog. So he had hundreds of blog posts about this spiritual leader that he followed, and they wrote all these things about his teachings and things, and there was this massive blog and he wanted a much more searchable, filterable, indexable way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Than a normal WordPress blog where you just have the posts in reverse chronological order. That wasn\'t how he wanted it to be. And so we built this j query table plugin for the client, which he obviously paid us for. And then [00:12:00] independently we built it into a sellable plugin. So we, uh, added a lot more features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We added settings, pages, the kind of things that you wouldn\'t realistically do on a client level project. So we put a lot more into. But the original idea came from this client. Um, we actually released that as a free plugin, which is still available on webpress.org now. It\'s called Post Table with Search and Sort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s basically the, um, bells and whistles version of what we did for the client. Um, but then once we\'d released the free plugin, we started to get feature requests. As you do when you put something out there. So people started asking for two key things. One was the ability to create a searchable table of custom post types.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that might be documents or members or articles, videos, audio, all these sorts of custom post types. Um, And the other was specifically W commerce products. So later in 2016 we built our [00:13:00] post table pro plugin, which lists custom post types in a searchable table and our product table plugin W Commerce product table, which takes your W Commerce products and puts them in like a.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Table, which is basically a one page order form. So that works really well because you\'ve got your variations and your quantity boxes and add to cart buttons all on this one page order form. So it\'s, even though it looks the same as the original table of blog posts. So it\'s actually a totally different purpose because it\'s an eCommerce order form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but the idea all came from that one client. And both of those projects have always been, those plugins have always been amongst our most successful. And WooCommerce product tables sold something like 1.2 million worth over its lifetime. And it is our biggest, um, lifetime selling plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Oh, that\'s excellent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I, I never asked revenue numbers, but thank you for sharing that, cuz I think that\'s, uh, inspired people to see how [00:14:00] you\'ve come and how it, you know, evolved as a framework for how they can do that in their own world. Um, the back to, so I, I love that kind of little mini story of how that post search table, I\'ve gotta look this up by the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, cuz I think we might need to post that, um, from, From that product came on our client. I hear that a lot and you gave such an amazing, um, example of how something can. Birth out of client work WooCommerce marketplace. You said the other one came from an idea on the Mark WooCommerce ideas place, but did, how did you get to WooCommerce?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Were you doing WooCommerce type projects for clients or did you say, did you just see that this thing called WooCommerce was coming, this big, big thing, or how did. Has it lead you to the marketplace to find that idea?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> We just knew that we commerce was big and we had also heard or felt, I don\'t remember that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, people are more inclined to buy premium [00:15:00] products, premium plugins, when that will make them money. Which makes sense, doesn\'t it? Mm-hmm. . So, uh, we particularly wanted to sell plugins for e for eCommerce because they would be easier to go premium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, I, So for my time at Ithe, um, we built, mostly, we ended up building, we meandered in the path to plugins and then we kind of found our niche was utility plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I always said, um, Hey, we\'re saving people money, time, and things like that. That\'s the stuff you think about, like insurance. I go, I gotta have insurance. Um, but it\'s not sexy. What sexy is making. You know, and, uh, we never got to this part of the making money part. We felt like we were helping people by extension make money and build their business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it\'s, it\'s so neat to hear you all saw, okay, this is something that people, if you help make them money, it\'s a really good thing. Cuz I said, Hey, nobody grabs about the bill of something that, like if you have your [00:16:00] PPC campaign or whatever going and it\'s convert. . Nobody complains much about that Bill, but you complain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I complain about our, our house insurance bill. You know, we gotta re up our house insurance bill because I don\'t think about like, well I don\'t want a fire to burn the house. I want to take care of itself. But on the other side to make money part is, is always felt easier to make that self. Cuz you\'re not a cost item per se.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\'re more like, No, this is essential to helping us keep making the money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Okay. And not just for the initial sale either, but for ongoing renewals because obviously most plugin companies now sell annually. And if the customer sees that value coming in from the product, they\'re more likely to keep paying as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we do quite a lot of analysis of our pricing to see what, um, is the best balance between sales. A cost per product and, and the W commerce versions always will justify a higher price than a general WordPress plugin. So, W Commerce Product Table and [00:17:00] Post Table Pro are good examples. Post Table Pro has never been able to justify the same price tag as product table because people are displaying information in a useful way rather than selling something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Okay, so were, Was there a point. After these two plugins start to have success and maybe others that you do, where you said we\'re, we\'re gonna, we\'re gonna thin down client work and we\'re gonna focus on, um, our, just our product and our plugins side of the business. And how did that, Yeah, how did you get to that decision?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> It happened surprisingly quickly. So we launched our first paid plugin in early March, 2016. And by August we were making decisions, Let\'s stop taking on new clients. So we\'ll follow through on existing projects, ex if existing clients want a new website, we\'ll do it. So we kind of slowed it down gradually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So by then the plugins were probably making, I dunno, [00:18:00] $5,000 a month or something, which was less than the client business, but enough to live on. Um, so we could feel fairly confident. And we also had the safety net of a large number of clients that we were hosting and maintaining their websites. So we kind felt that we could take that risk and not be, keep taking up our time building new client projects surprisingly quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So I\'m sure looking back, it feels like a magical time. It was for me when you go, Okay, this thing that we did, Is working and there\'s another opportunity here to, uh, you mentioned lifestyle in, in the beginning here is, and, and that\'s what motivated me too, is always to have this, Oh, this is working. Where could it lead?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it feels, it feels magical to me, but how, how does that, reflecting back in 2016, those six months or so, from. Wow, this could actually be a thing. Oh, this is, oh, we should make these [00:19:00] decisions to do this. Reflecting back, how does that whole time period, uh, feel and how do you think about it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Well, the first sale was amazing cuz we just, so we used our existing website, which was@thetimebantu.co uk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We eventually went to bantu.com but that took years. Um, so we had quite good SEO from the client business, so we didn\'t want us. Start again with a new domain or anything. So we put up a, a plugin section on our agency website. So we were advertising web design services and plugins on, you know, different menu tabs, basically, um, added some blog posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because our first plugin, we commerce password protected categories was unique in the market, uh, there was no competition and we ranked very quickly. Which was amazing. And so, um, it actually was literally a few days before the first sale came and we were like, What? We saw this email, new plugin sale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s not one of our [00:20:00] tests. That\'s a real person. Oh my God. And we didn\'t even know it would ever sell. Um, so the first sale was really interesting because that\'s the first kind of evidence that people might actually find our website that way and buy things on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> That\'s awesome. Okay, let\'s fast forward a little bit to today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you, what do you offer and what are you doing with Barn two? Let\'s see, what if I\'m doing my math? Six plus years later, almost six years later, you\'re kind of coming up, You\'re already past your anniversary of that big decision. Now what? What are you doing at Barn two? Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> so kind of more of the same really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we\'ve taken what worked and kept doing it. Um, we now have 19 premium plugins, plus maybe four or five free ones. And we have a team of about 14 people, um, who are all, um, working independently around the world. Um, [00:21:00] so from their, their. Uh, so we\'ve got like a support team and a development team and a marketing team, which is amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but ultimately we are just trying to kind of replicate what we started and scale it up cuz it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, it, it for sure did. Congratulations on your success and what you built so far today. Um, it\'s uh, I think a lot of people dream, Oh, I\'d like where Katie is now. That\'s where I want to be. And how do you get there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think you\'ve shared so many key parts to the story. Definitely resonate with me, um, about building product, business. And I go back to what you. Find what works, keep doing it and if it stops working, find something else that\'s working and doing that. Um, I know we talked about some of the original ideas that came from Woo Marketplace looking in, seeing, seeing an opportunity there, and the other side was clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any other thoughts about how, how you go about, or how someone else could go about finding the opportunities for [00:22:00] products as they\'re building their.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Just keep it in mind really, the information, the insights are probably there. If you are in the WordPress industry, you\'re doing projects, you\'re building websites for people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would be surprised if you weren\'t coming across gaps in the market. And, um, if you do a bit of research, you can find out if other people are looking for the same thing that your client has found that doesn\'t exist. Maybe you\'ve recently done some custom code and customization for, I dunno, the events calendar or something that what, there wasn\'t a feature built in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so you\'ve written something bespoke that might be a plug-in idea for an extension you could sell. Um, there\'s tons of things like that in all the major plugins, um, like eCommerce. Easy digital downloads, gravity forms and so on. There\'s all these gaps. So if you are using these tools and customizing them, there\'s then to have a think about whether that\'s a product idea,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> it, it\'s part of your experience, part of your expertise, and seems [00:23:00] like a good place to start for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, when we started, I think we started with themes. And, uh, eventually we got into plugins because it was, it was definitely part of conversations I was having, uh, seeing that there was this opportunity with plugins, but it came out of a need for us in those, Just listening to customers, like you\'re saying, is just.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are the things that people are bumping into that are problems that probably are valuable if you can solve those problems, Like your, um, your custom posts searched and organized plugin came out of that one person with this massive site. And then did you start asking like, what were the questions you started asking for me with, for instance, back, but when that, that was not my idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It came from our team and I go, Oh, a backup. Click in. My first question was, everybody needs a backup of their web WordPress website that came out of our own pain. Um, but where were some of those questions you started asking as you determine like, this [00:24:00] is feasible for us to take time, resources, energy, You know, I, we\'ll talk about like getting things off the ground to, from a marketing side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know, um, too, because I want to tap into that experience you have and expertise. But, um, what were some of those questions you asked when you\'re like, How do I. How do I determine, make this decision? This is worth some time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Well, to be honest, we did had a lot of randomness and luck and instincts. We weren\'t brilliant at establishing that data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, we\'ve worked a lot with ellipses to reduce randomness. Um, you know, the marketing company for WordPress, uh, product companies, sis, and, um, because we. Checking that it didn\'t exist. So we were checking, there was a gap, but we weren\'t establishing the, the demand. Sometimes we would just do it because it was new and have a go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so that, yeah, we probably [00:25:00] wasted some resources there. Uh, and um, so that has been an ongoing challenge and not something we\'ve always been brilliant at, but the data is there and if you hire an SEO company or something, you can find out about search volumes or, or just go on Google Trends yourself and see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I love your authenticity though to say that because that\'s so reflective of my own experience and I think of many others. We don\'t just look into it crystal long. Go. There it is. Sure. Maybe that that\'s out there. I have this great idea. I think it would work, but there\'s probably so much backstory to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The story I tell often, and so much of this is experiments and over time I tried to make my experiments, uh, cost less and less and less because I made some very expensive. Experiment, failures, you know? Yeah. But I just love your genuineness of saying like, it, we didn\'t have it all together and neither did we, by the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, when you\'re starting and you start to hone that process, like that laboratory process, [00:26:00] I read a book called Little Bets and I back in the day and I go, Oh, I shouldn\'t just go. Um, see an opportunity. Let\'s run for it. Maybe there\'s some nuance there. Uh, one of the mistakes that we made that I often say when people ask me about my failures, particularly in product, I say, uh, I call it, I think it\'s exchange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in this day, we were seeing the WooCommerce market really grow and explode and, um, it seemed very complex to me, and our opportunities started at, or the, the thought started. There should be a simpler way to do e-commerce for the person actually running the site, putting their products on the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we started, I think, exchange with that kind of premise, but we didn\'t do a lot more thought past that. And it ended up costing us probably 400,000, $500,000 fixed cost. Not to, not to mention opportunity costs. So I use that as my thing. It\'s like, okay, why did I. Why did that fail? Where did we go [00:27:00] wrong?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I\'d say that like there\'s so many failures that get to like, you know, get to, Oh, this is it. But I just keep anchoring back to your client\'s story when they birth out of either your experiences, like you said, or a client that see and like, Oh, could other people use this? How much do they value those things?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I sometimes probably get thought, get paralyzed in that over analysis. But there is some here of. Those basic questions of like, is this something that we think could go and going from hunch to actually, let\'s put it out there and test it. Do you have any thoughts around that too? Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> yeah. I\'ve never been a big risk taker and I like small risks, um, that aren\'t like gonna break the bank if they\'re not successful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, so. The, you know, where we haven\'t established the market first, it wasn\'t a huge amount of development time to get the product out there, for example. Um, we now have a formula which [00:28:00] we use to evaluate new plugin ideas, which looks at factors such as, uh, search volume. Other searches for that, um, concept going up or down, competitiveness, um, difficulty to develop that kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we\'ve got this, this whole spreadsheets that we plug new ideas into with some data, so that helps. But yeah, I, I\'ve always been scared of themes because I perceive them as being really huge and a big risk to develop. But you were very brave starting with</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> themes. It was much more complex in two thou. I mean, I\'m sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much more simple in 2008, by the way, than it is today. Um, for for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. Cause it was about 2013 that it changed, which is when we were trying to build a theme and suddenly these multipurpose themes flooded the market, didn\'t they?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yes, absolutely. And, and that\'s the other part I think you even mentioned in there is competition is seeing what other people are doing out there in the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we did backup Buddy, there wasn\'t really [00:29:00] anything that, what we felt was a holistic backup plugin to do backups, migrations, restoring of websites. And so, but, but again, it was early enough where there wasn\'t a lot. Now, today, totally different story. If we\'re going, we want do a backup plugin, well, There\'s, look at the landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s pretty competitive. The other side, and I love your input on this too, is that so many people, as we the theme market, got so competitive. And people would say, Do you think you could build start, Someone could build, Not even me, just someone could build a theme company. And early on in my, uh, naiveness, I said, um, I don\'t think so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it\'d be really, really tough. Well then probably right as, as I say that companies like Beaver Builder come out and I\'m. Wow. Even the competitive, what I viewed as a competitive market, they saw a way to innovate that changed the game. Now they would say, I think [00:30:00] it\'s a plugin versus a theme, but I, But to me, they had a different perspective and they looked at some of what I was buried in complexity and go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, there\'s this, and then, then this whole page builder market starts. Um, and so that\'s always interesting too, is just when I, I, I always say never because when I have said, I don\'t think so, someone ever else goes but here, and it\'s so cool with the innovation that you can do in market. And</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> that\'s an interesting example cuz I think a lot of the, uh, Beaver Builder diehards are developers and people that are quite, uh, into WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and I know that\'s not their whole market, but I think they go more in that direction in terms of their fan base. So they kind of found a bit of a gap as well from say the visual composer types who are very much not that group at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Um, well, okay, so let\'s, we\'ve talked about kind of getting plugin, evaluating it and all the story that goes a part of that where [00:31:00] Barn two is today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, the other compelling question that we talked about before, uh, before we had this, we started recording, was the whole marketing of plugins. Um, and. Particularly, I know this was something that you started with, with the agency back in the day, was your emphasis on marketing too, but how do you think about marketing plugins?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, we\'ve gotten past decision, we\'re building it, we\'ve got it ready to go. And then just that big, broad question of how do you market plugins?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Well because I\'m not a big risk taker, I try to keep it small, but fi cuz with WordPress, in particularly with commerce, small, is a huge market because even the tiniest things there are loads of people searching for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if I was going to launch, An events plugin or a membership plugin, I don\'t think I would be that successful, to be honest. Uh, because it\'s so competitive. How are you going to rank for WordPress membership plugin? Never gonna happen, or you\'d have to be very, very good. But [00:32:00] to rank for something really specific that doesn\'t exist in the market is actually quite easy, particularly if you already.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say an agency website that you can start selling your products on and blogging on about your products and that you\'ve got some domain authority built up. So my advice, um, if, if you\'ve not got a huge budget and massive marketing skills is to go for the niches and find something specific that you have got a reasonable chance of success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> As you\'re looking back to, do you think there were, where were the catalyst moments when. You know, you\'re, you\'re starting to get a flow in of customers that\'s kind of growing. Um, and like, oh, this point here, when this happened, things started to take off from marketing or customer, you know, incoming customers or things like that, that you think made the difference that you think about quite a bit today in terms of the marketing and growth of [00:33:00] the products that you offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Um, it\'s funny cuz what we do now is kind of the same things that we always did, which is finding content opportunities that fill a gap that isn\'t already catered for and a bit of ads and things like that. So it was just about really getting, there wasn\'t really a catalyst moment because we did that from day one based on experience of marketing the agency business, it\'s more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reducing the randomness as I talked about earlier, and fine tuning that process so that you can predict the chance of success more before you start throwing things out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, I, The first month, that first eight months of item I tell people a lot is that I was doing support cuz I was the only person and um, oh yes, but I cannot take that experience back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would never want to because I learned so much about the who I thought. For, for the tenure, I [00:34:00] was, uh, part of Mythe. I always thought I\'m our, I\'m our base user. I\'m not very technical. I\'m technical enough. I can take a plugin, I can use it, um, but I\'m not gonna get into PHP or anything like that. And that helped us maintain our cut or who we were and what we did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that first eight months was so interesting, just like when I\'ve talked to our agency owners at post status. Um, you, you said this from the beginning, I just kind of assumed, if you like, from the agency mindset, um, you\'d start. And then you\'d hire a full-time person. That\'s a wrong assumption. I\'ve, I\'ve heard over and over you started with contractors or freelancers that helped you with your capacity of the work, and I\'ve heard that so many times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was a nuance because I haven\'t been an agency owner that I learned, but those eight months that I themes, I realized. Um, a couple insights that now in reflection, you know, a long time past, it drove all of our key values because I was getting to understand the actual customers. They were freelancers, [00:35:00] solar printers out there, just kind of doing Lance web, WordPress web design on the side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And eventually it would birth into something like you all did too. Um, and. Just knowing that helped me. And then just seeing the customer. We had a forum at the time. Everybody\'s asking about CSS customization. We would do a theme with the right sidebar. Now remember, don\'t make, this is 2008. So like they\'d, we\'d release a theme with the right sidebar and they\'d say, Well, they wanted on the left, and we\'d help \'em with the css.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was this thing of just noticing and observing what people were actually asking for and putting the head their headset. Headset on and saying, Okay, I wanted to be able to have this flexibility that helped us figure out what next products and what next features we would do because we kept really close to the customer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Are there things that in your experience, you\'ve seen too or kind of, It doesn\'t have to be that, but I was trying to give an example to say, I know some of those [00:36:00] things were critical to our success, staying close to the customer, but there are other things that Jesus go, This happened, we learned from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\'re gonna do that over and over and over. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Um, there\'s a few things to unpick there. We\'ve definitely listened to the customers, not just our initial clients. So I did the support myself for much longer than I should have done until it basically just became unmanageable because it was so many tickets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, but that gave, as you said, that gave me. Such a unique insight into our products and how people are using them so that then I could use that to inform new product decisions, new features, that kind of thing. But even now, we have a support team, which I think is six people as of a couple of weeks ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, we have a very comprehensive feature request list for each product where they put things on every days and that we, you know, We got formula again to say, uh, the demand and the difficulty and the impacts and stuff like that, and how [00:37:00] many people are waiting so that I can go in there and see what people are asking for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, and we have quite a loose interpretation of what makes a feature request. They may not be explicitly asking for something, but if that would meet their need, then we put it on the list, if that makes sense. Um, so we try to be quite, um, open. That so we\'ve got more feedback, um, recorded. So that really helps because you get that insight to, as you say, reduce randomness and know what to build that will work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so for example, tons of our eCommerce product table customers were asking for quick view buttons in their table and they were asking for us to add that to their plugin, which makes sense. Can you add quick view? And we thought, hang. Quick view is not just for product table, that is for any store. You don\'t have to be using the product table layout to want quick V buttons in order to, uh, view more information and add to the cart without [00:38:00] visiting the separate product pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we built a WooCommerce Quick View plugin, which again is still available today, uh, and integrated it with product Table. So when we buy Product Table now, you can either buy it on its own or there\'s like a bundle with Quick View, which quite a lot of customers go for. Um, and you can buy Quick View as a standalone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you would kind of look at what the customers are asking for and then make business decisions around that. Uh, but the other side of what you were saying was about building a team and, um, hiring staff straight away. And because I\'ve always been a bit risk averse, I\'ve waited until we\'re making money, um, until committing, um, particularly big commitments like staff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And rather than freelancers. But it\'s interesting seeing more and more at the moment WordPress companies with the more of the startup model where they\'re seeking funding and so on. Cause that\'s something I\'ve got no experience of personally and I\'ve, we just [00:39:00] bootstrapped it, done the work ourselves until we can afford to hire people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and that\'s worked for us. So I watch with interest people with a different model because it\'s like bringing. Big business into WordPress. And you see that more and more the last couple of years, don\'t you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Oh yeah. And, and that was one of the primary drivers for us selling. Um, And being, being acquired is that there is a lot of money, big money coming, coming, continually coming into the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, okay. So Katie, I, we\'ve talked about this past, thank you so much for just sharing that cause I think that\'s so inspiring and helpful for others trying to do. Even just the agency part, you know, And then get to a, what you said, the ceiling and going, Okay, what\'s next? What do we do? And oh, there\'s, there\'s these things that come out and, uh, then the present we\'re born to is now, but what is exciting about you and Barn to in the future?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\'s getting you revved up about what you\'re doing, where you\'re going and [00:40:00] want to share with others about barn? Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> I think kind of keeping going and, uh, it\'s working, um, doing more, We are getting more ambitious with the sorts of plugins that we will release now. Our SEOs better and we know what works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I still don\'t think I\'d have the confidence to do something really generic like a membership plugin. Um, but we are trying to have a ban to version of all of the Major W. So, for example, last month we launched a filter plugin. Um, actually there isn\'t a major version of that. There\'s a, There wasn\'t, Yeah, that\'s a bad example because there wasn\'t a major, major competitor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, um, that was quite a, it was our most complex plugin that we\'d built. So, um, we were ambitious in that. Sense. And, uh, in the next week or so, we\'re going to launch a, uh, product option plugin. And there is a very strong, um, official version of product add-ons and we, but we\'ve looked at what the gaps are and um, in what ways that plugin is not [00:41:00] like, and, uh, fix that in our own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that\'s exciting to see how that does, um, and just keep, um, doing what we\'re doing. All right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Well Katie, can you tell the, tell, tell listeners where we can find more about you and also Barn two in your work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Um, well the best place is our website, barn two.com. Um, and you can also find us, um, on Twitter at Barn two plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Excellent. And, and also I\'m post out a slack. Um, but I don\'t want people bombarding you, but I know you\'re so generous with your expertise and your success story and everything like that. Katie, thank you so much, uh, for coming along and sharing your story. We need more like this, more willing to kind of share the story as inspiration, and you\'ve been so generous and kind to share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These parts that others can look at and go, Gosh, I need to think about this part that you shared. So thank you for sharing your story and thank you for your time today. And I\'ll see you in post at Slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie Keith:</strong> Yeah.

Feedback from plugin developers indicates this was an unpopular decision and a failure of communication. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I want to echo disappointed in that chart being removed,&#8221; Equalize Digital CEO Amber Hinds said. &#8220;I hope we&#8217;ll hear something soon. In an ideal world this commit should be rolled back pending community discussion.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach Tirrell, product manager at Liquid Web, said, &#8220;We get very limited metrics from the plugin directory and this one was very important to plugin authors.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden-Chomphosy joined the discussion in the channel but had very little information to offer about why this change was made without any public discussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The data shared is always a bit obfuscated so that it’s harder to &#8216;game the system&#8217;—the same reason we don’t have running leaderboards for contributions,&#8221; Haden-Chomphosy said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Suggestions are welcome for how to get some data for you all while doing our best to stick with a &#8216;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coopetition\" target=\"_blank\">co-opetition</a>&#8216; mindset.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Co-opetition is a term coined to meld the concepts of cooperation and competition to create a system where different vendors cooperate for the benefit of the system while still competing. Haden-Chomphosy did not elaborate but it seems that obfuscating data had been deemed a necessary sacrifice for the sake of co-opetition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Audrey Capital-sponsored meta contributor Scott Reilly, who committed the change, said &#8220;the implementation made it possible to deduce the stats we were looking to obfuscate.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all plugin authors agree that these stats need to be obfuscated, nor do opaque decisions like this one inspire trust in those who are cutting off access to the data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The real data exists,&#8221;  Yoast founder Joost de Valk said. &#8220;Automattic is one of the companies buying plugins and has access to the exact data and now even more than before, others do not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The whole coopetition nonsense is all interesting, but I would say this is an unfair advantage. Literally every other open source system out there just opens these numbers publicly, and so should we.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has still not been confirmed whether this decision was rooted in a security issue, but de Valk and others are imploring WordPress.org&#8217;s decision makers to bring the data back until a suitable alternative in available. Participants on the <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511\">ticket</a> have also urged WordPress&#8217; leadership to open a discussion with the plugin developer community about what would data would help them in the creation of an alternative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Thank you for the feedback, and I do realize that there were a number of third party commercial and free services scraping these data en masse and using it,&#8221; Matt Mullenweg commented on the ticket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If someone has reasons to bring it back that haven&#8217;t been presented above already, please add it to this thread so we have the best possible presentation of that side of the argument to consider.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a 10-month hiatus from his <a href=\"https://wptrends.co/\">WP Trends</a> newsletter, Iain Poulson returned today with an issue titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://s.wptrends.co/w/kWJrSn4PAY2Xziux1YiYEQ\">Second-Class Third-Party Developers</a>&#8221; that identifies this clawback of active install growth data as &#8220;a symptom of the wider issue that WordPress doesn’t really want to support third-party developers who build freemium plugins.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Because of this, the data insights for developers is severely lacking and it&#8217;s&nbsp;one of the reasons I created&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://pluginrank.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Plugin Rank</a>&nbsp;and why other solutions like&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wpmetrics.dev/\" target=\"_blank\">wpMetrics</a>&nbsp;exist and both will be impacted by this change. That&#8217;s not to say other platforms and marketplaces are perfect, but they don’t seem to work against developers like WordPress.org does. As a plugin developer trying to grow a business, data is everything and the data from the directory&nbsp;is&nbsp;poor and requires a large overhaul&nbsp;to improve what is collected.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poulson contends WordPress.org could even go beyond the previously offered data and add new installs per day/month, how many existing sites updated per day/month, and the search terms leading to the download.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Freemium Plugin developers shouldn’t be treated like second-class citizens in the ecosystem,&#8221; Poulson said. &#8220;Even developers with just free&nbsp;plugins should be able to see decent statistics. There&#8217;s no incentive to keep developing plugins if you don’t know people are using them.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the lack of meaningful data for developers who are trying to monitor the trajectory of their free plugins, the non-transparent decision from the meta team seems to be the greater issue at hand for many participants in the resulting discussions. The sting of another closed-door decision cannot easily be explained away with a fancy portmanteau that promotes cooperation without adequate communication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If plugin developers cannot be trusted to act &#8220;co-opetively&#8221; with this data, will WordPress continue collecting it? Who has private access to it? Why weren&#8217;t alternatives explored before silently removing access? These questions need to be answered in the process of finding a way forward for improving plugin data after this decision.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 04 Oct 2022 03:15:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"Post Status: Open Source Communities: You May Not Be Interested in CISA, But CISA is Very Interested in You\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=126155\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:116:\"https://poststatus.com/open-source-communities-you-may-not-be-interested-in-cisa-but-cisa-is-very-interested-in-you/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:17221:\"<div class=\"e-content\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-41 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-2-color has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">United States national security interests are poised to become more invested in and engaged with open source projects classified as public infrastructure.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf\">memorandum M-16-21</a> then, which required that all federal agencies open all new custom code for reuse by all other agencies and release 20% or more of any new custom code as free and open source. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things have changed, but not the importance of open source software in government and <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/infrastructure-security\">critical infrastructure</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is risk tolerance, which is <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/importance-tech-government-obamas-chief-staff/\">never high in government</a>, that has diminished greatly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, open source software is increasingly associated with risk, if only because it has become so successful. It\'s a huge attack surface in the middle of a seemingly permanent and escalating cyberwar, a cold war that never ended, or what is more commonly seen now as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth-generation_warfare\">fifth-generation warfare</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s logical for government to <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/when-the-free-rider-is-government/\">step in to try to reduce that risk</a>. Since the Apache <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4j#Log4Shell_vulnerability\">Log4j/Log4shell vulnerability</a> (<a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228\">Base CVSS score of 10</a>) became public in December 2021, those big wheels have started to turn. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-there-was-a-pretty-big-government-response\">&#8220;There was a pretty big government response&#8221;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A critical vulnerability in the widely used Java logging tool (Log4j, specifically a Log4j 2 dependency, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell\">Log4shell</a>) turned out to have been exploitable for about a decade, giving potential attackers &#8220;easy access to internal networks,&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/dec/10/software-flaw-most-critical-vulnerability-log-4-shell\">according</a> to <em>The Guardian</em>. (It even touched WordPress, through Openverse, but was quickly handled <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2022/01/05/journal-entry-log4j-vulnerability/\">as Chloe Bringmann later reported</a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often described as the most serious vulnerability in a decade (if not all time), the US government response it motivated was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/09/22/senators-introduce-bill-protect-open-source-software/\">recently summarized</a> in <em>The Washington Post</em>. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) led that response and will be leading new initiatives regarding open source in the near future. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, &#8220;CISA <a href=\"https://www.cyberscoop.com/log4j-cisa-easterly-most-serious/\">briefed industry leaders</a>, issued <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news/2021/12/17/cisa-issues-emergency-directive-requiring-federal-agencies-mitigate-apache-log4j\">an emergency order</a> for federal agencies to patch the issue and <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news/2021/12/22/cisa-fbi-nsa-and-international-partners-issue-advisory-mitigate-apache-log4j\">jointly published an alert</a> with the FBI, National Security Agency and governments around the world.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that, all attention turned to future risk mitigation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\">Like <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/current-activity/2021/04/16/wordpress-releases-security-and-maintenance-update\">CISA in the US</a>, the <a href=\"https://cyber.gc.ca/en/cccshomepage\">Canadian Centre for Cyber Security</a> already distributes a vague and clumsy &#8220;WordPress security advisory&#8221; from time to time. Expect it to improve — there\'s a lot of money and jobs for it in the federal pipeline. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Who shows up when decisions are being made?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In January this year, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) warned companies to remediate the Log4shell flaw or <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2022/01/ftc-warns-companies-remediate-log4j-security-vulnerability\">face potential legal action</a>. And the White House <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/13/readout-of-white-house-meeting-on-software-security/\">brought in leaders from major tech companies</a> to discuss <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/14/open-source-bugs-present-an-extermination-problem-government/\">what might be done</a> about widely used and under-maintained open source software. Only three organizations represented open source at that meeting, including the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Security_Foundation\">Open Source Security Foundation</a>, a project of the Linux Foundation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress was not publicly represented in these proceedings or any that have followed. In January, <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-as-a-commons/\">Lesley Sim</a> and others in the WordPress community asked, &#8220;Who represents our open source commons?&#8221; And the question keeps coming up. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f997.png\" alt=\"🦗\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tech Security Experts and Foreign Policy Interests Converge on Software Supply Chains</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee held <a href=\"https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/hearings/responding-to-and-learning-from-the-log4shell-vulnerability\">a hearing</a> on Log4Shell and open source security in February. The speakers involved, the discussion that took place, and subsequent legislative development indicate federal funding and involvement in open source is coming. It\'s just a matter of when and how much. GovTech did a nice <a href=\"https://www.govtech.com/security/apache-software-foundation-talks-log4j-open-source-security\">summary</a> of the event, but there are some things on the speakers\' prepared statements worth singling out. The Q&A; is also <a href=\"https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/hearings/responding-to-and-learning-from-the-log4shell-vulnerability\">worth watching</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>David Nalley, Apache Software Foundation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>David Nalley, President of the Apache Software Foundation, was the first to speak. The words &#8220;non-profit,&#8221; &#8220;charity,&#8221; and &#8220;contributors&#8221; figured early and prominently in Nalley\'s <a href=\"https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Testimony-Nalley-2022-02-08.pdf\">brief statement</a>. (Later &#8220;free riders&#8221; came up in the Q&A.;) He emphasized a need for government investment in software supply chain security and the problem of getting updates out to vulnerable systems. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Brad Arkin, Cisco Systems</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://newsroom.cisco.com/c/r/newsroom/en/us/executives/brad-arkin.html\">Brad Arkin</a>, Senior Vice President, Chief Security and Trust Officer for Cisco Systems, also emphasized the need to be able to see the maintenance status of all software in use and make rapid upgrades — without overly focusing on Log4shell or regarding open source as being especially risky. Architecting systems with the &#8220;necessary separation inside&#8221; them to limit any damage and &#8220;providing transparency about<br />software components &#8230; through a software bill of materials (SBOM)&#8221; capped off his recommendations.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><p>A “software bill of materials” (SBOM) has emerged as a key building block in software security and software supply chain risk management. An SBOM is a nested inventory, a list of ingredients that make up software components.  The SBOM work has advanced since 2018 as a collaborative community effort, driven by <a href=\"http://ntia.gov/SBOM\">National Telecommunications and Information Administration’s (NTIA) multistakeholder process</a>. </p><cite>CISA &lt;<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sbom\">https://www.cisa.gov/sbom</a>></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Jen Miller-Osborn, Palo Alto Networks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/author/jen-miller-osborn/\">Jen Miller-Osborn</a>, Deputy Director of Threat Intelligence at Palo Alto Networks, went into greater technical detail with similar recommendations for containment, SBOMS, <a href=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-a-zero-trust-architecture\">zero trust network architecture</a>, etc. One item of note to software engineering teams stressed the value of <a href=\"https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-devsecops\">Development Security Operations</a> (DevSecOps):</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Impressive work is already being done in this arena, but the community would be<br />well-served by increasing adoption of existing development tools to control access to open source components. These tools can scan all of the open source packages for both integrity and security before they are approved and allowed for engineering teams to use in products. Our recently released <a href=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/state-of-cloud-native-security\">State of Cloud Security Report 2022</a>, which surveyed over 3,000 IT professionals, found that organizations with tightly integrated DevSecOps principles were more than seven times likely to have strong or very strong security posture. They were also more than nine times more likely to have low levels of security friction.</p><cite>&lt;<a href=\"https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Testimony-Miller-Osborn-2022-02-08.pdf\">https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Testimony-Miller-Osborn-2022-02-08.pdf</a>&gt;</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Trey Herr, The Atlantic Council</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/trey-herr/\">Dr. Trey Herr</a>, Director of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council, was the last to speak. An academic and lobbyist, he was the only member of the panel not from the tech industry. Notably, the Atlantic Council promotes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanticism\">Atlanticism</a> and has <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/about/history/\">historic ties to NATO</a> as <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/issue/nato/\">an advocate for NATO interests</a>. Dr. Herr took a slightly more alarmist view of open source as especially risk-prone. In his very goal-oriented, politically savvy statements, he called for DHS through CISA to fund and directly involve itself in the open source community:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>This office should further encourage collaboration among the United States and allies in supporting the security of open source projects identified as critical by the office and act as a community liaison/security evangelist for the open-source community across the federal government.</p><cite>&lt;<a href=\"https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Testimony-Herr-2022-02-08.pdf\">https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Testimony-Herr-2022-02-08.pdf</a>&gt;</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Further, &#8220;Open-source security should be part of mainstream supply chain security policymaking, and this office would be charged with supporting those efforts while acting as the single point of contact for external stakeholders.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Deep Pockets Ready to Spend</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Herr also pointed to:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8230;<a href=\"https://amendments-rules.house.gov/amendments/LANGEV_068_xml220128115401119.pdf\">a proposed amendment</a> to <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4521\">HR 4521</a>, the America COMPETES Act of 2022, that would authorize the creation of a set of Critical Technology Security Centers inside of DHS [through CISA], including one focused specifically on open-source security. </p><cite>&lt;<a href=\"https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Testimony-Herr-2022-02-08.pdf\">https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Testimony-Herr-2022-02-08.pdf</a>&gt;</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>He then urged the Senators present to support this legislation &#8220;when it reaches the Senate, with the understanding that a substantial portion of moneys appropriated for these centers, on the order of $20 to $30 million a year, is dedicated to this open-source mission.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In subsequent years, Herr predicted hundreds of millions would be spent on open source security by the federal government — all with the goal of: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8230;focusing on secure developer tools and “foundational” infrastructure for the open-source ecosystem, to incentivize rebuilding codebases in memory-safe languages, to support audits and volunteer labor to identify and patch vulnerabilities, and to support efforts to drive security talent into this space and towards the most impactful libraries and packages in open source.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In May, a second Open Source Software Security Summit was held in Washington, DC when &#8220;the Linux Foundation and OpenSSF gathered a cross-section of open source developer and commercial ecosystem representatives along with leaders and experts from key U.S. federal agencies.&#8221; Their goal was to build a mobilization plan — &#8220;a consensus on high-impact actions to take to improve the resiliency and security of open source software.&#8221;  They came up with <a href=\"https://openssf.org/oss-security-mobilization-plan/\">10 areas of focus to improve OSS security</a> and called for immediate funding from the tech industry in the ballpark of USD 150 million.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Securing Open Source Software Act</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In late September, Senators Gary Peters (D-Mich.) and Republican Rob Portman (R-Ohio) <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4913\">introduced legislation</a> that directs CISA to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>&#8220;Hire open-source experts.&#8221;</li><li>&#8220;Publish a framework on open-source code risk&#8221; within a year and then regularly &#8220;perform an assessment of open-source code components that federal agencies commonly use.&#8221;</li><li>Study, within two years, whether their risk assessment framework &#8220;could be used in critical infrastructure outside the government and potentially work with one or more critical infrastructure sectors to voluntarily test the idea.&#8221;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/09/22/senators-introduce-bill-protect-open-source-software/\">noted</a>, &#8220;Other agencies would have roles as well, such as the Office of Management and Budget publishing guidance to federal chief information officers on the secure use of open-source software.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Open Source Software as Public Infrastructure</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Trey Herr was <a href=\"https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/media/majority-media/peters-and-portman-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-help-secure-open-source-software_\">very positive</a> about the Peters-Portman Act, saying:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“This important&nbsp;legislation&nbsp;will,&nbsp;for the first&nbsp;time ever, codify&nbsp;open source software as public infrastructure. If signed into law, it would serve as a historic step&nbsp;for wider federal support for the health and security of open source software.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>While it may not be possible to rush through Congress before it\'s out of session this year, it seems very likely the Act will drive greater self-regulation in open source — and bring in new government requirements to comply with. Parallel developments are happening in Europe where investment in open source as a public good has advocates arguing it leads to <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/study-about-impact-open-source-software-and-hardware-technological-independence-competitiveness-and\">nearly a hundredfold return</a>. Opportunities will surely emerge from new sources of funding and jobs for open source, but national and regional geopolitics may complicate the nature of contribution within truly global and international projects. </p>\n</div><p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 03 Oct 2022 19:22:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"<span class=\'p-author h-card\'>Dan Knauss</span>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:117:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 40: All Things Testing with Special Guests Anne McCarthy and Brian Alexander\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=13551\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:119:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/10/episode-40-all-things-testing-with-special-guests-anne-mccarthy-and-brian-alexander/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36353:\"<p>In the fortieth episode of the WordPress Briefing, Josepha Haden Chomphosy sits down with special guests Anne McCarthy and Brian Alexander to discuss the Testing Team and how to get started with testing in the WordPress project. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Have a question you&#8217;d like answered?

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I have with us today on the WordPress Briefing a couple of special guests. I have <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ironprogrammer/\">Brian Alexander</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/annezazu/\">Anne McCarthy</a>. I&#8217;m gonna ask you both to tell us a little bit about yourselves, if you can tell us what you do with the WordPress project, maybe how long you&#8217;ve been with WordPress, and if there are any particular teams that you contribute to, that would be great.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian, why don&#8217;t you get us started?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:01:02]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Brian. I work on the WordPress project as a full-time contributor, sponsored by Automattic. And I am one of the Test Team reps, so I help promote testing across the project. And that&#8217;s not just in Core, but it could be for Themes, Performance, feature plugins, what have you. So try to make that stuff move forward and wrangle as many people as we can to get on board and help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:32]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent. All right, and Anne, what about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:01:36]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spearhead the Full Site Editing outreach program. I am a sponsor contributor for Automattic as well, and so I contribute across a couple of different teams depending upon what the outreach program needs as well as various release squads I have been a part of. So for 6.1 coming up, I&#8217;m one of the co-Core Editor triage leads.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian is also on the squad as the co-Test lead, which is very exciting. So it&#8217;s been fun to work with him and be on the podcast. And I&#8217;ve been around the WordPress project since about 2011. But this is, the last couple of years, the first time I&#8217;ve been able to be sponsored by Automattic and be a part of giving back to the community that&#8217;s given me so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:13]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazing. All right. For folks who&#8217;ve been listening to the WP Briefing for a while, you know that I&#8217;ve been saying for like a full year that I think that testing is one of the best onboarding opportunities we have. And then also I really like to bring in our co-creators of WordPress through that testing program. Because we don&#8217;t know whether we&#8217;re right or not unless people tell us that we&#8217;re right or not. And we would like to hear so much from the users who, you know, use it and don&#8217;t necessarily have an opportunity, that privilege to kind of build on it or build the CMS itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I just have a few questions since I&#8217;ve got a couple of our strong testing wranglers here. The first thing I have is what are you doing? Or, do you have any advice for getting people outside of our active contributor base and the community to participate in testing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:03:03]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can kick this off. Just thinking about the Full Site Editing outreach program model. So just for context, there are various calls for testing in different formats. So everything from really procedural where you&#8217;re following exact steps to follow, to very open-ended calls for testing, as well as we recently did usability testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of the things that come to mind immediately just for getting different contributors is to have very specific, fun, engaging, relevant tests that can draw people in. So if you have a call for testing that really speaks to someone, they might be more willing to participate. As well as just different formats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So someone may not want to, you know, follow 30 steps, but they might want to follow something more open-ended. They might want to answer a survey rather than opening a GitHub link. And so I think a lot of facilitation with the outreach program has served us really well to bring in different folks as well as explicitly reaching out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve done a number of talks in different WordPress related spaces and non-WordPress spaces to try to tell people about what we&#8217;re up to and really go meet them where they are. Because I think that&#8217;s ultimately, especially with Covid and the pandemic, there was a really unique opportunity to do that and to join the random online meetup that was happening and talk about the program and talk about ways that people could get involved and feel heard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:04:12]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the last thing I&#8217;ll mention is translations. The program that&#8217;s culture testing that I write is written in English, but I&#8217;m very fortunate to have people who translate those. And so that&#8217;s a huge way that I cannot contribute but that other people have. And so I really want to highlight that and call that out because it&#8217;s been hugely impactful to have these calls for testing in a way that people can more readily access.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:32]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:04:35]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I was going to add in, in addition to the calls for testing that are, as Anne said, structured such to isolate so that someone can just kind of go through a list of steps to do rather than just being exposed to Trac or GitHub and have kind of snow blindness with, with everything that&#8217;s happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a Week in Test series of posts that goes out about every week. And what we try to do with that series is to curate a list of posts that might be a good starting point. So we try to find one that, in each type of testing example, is something that would, a more novice contributor might be able to start with. Things for more intermediate and then also advanced ones that, for testers who may need to have a development environment and the ability to make some pretty deep or type of customizations to their WordPress project in order to test a patch or reproduce a particular issue that might be happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s a good springboard for someone to come in where there&#8217;s just a small thing that they can kind of look at and then dive into the larger process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:46]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely. That&#8217;s very smart. It&#8217;s hard to figure out how to get started in WordPress at all, let alone as a contributing by testing things sort of area. That feels new to WordPress even though the team has been around for a long time. And so I think that&#8217;s excellent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian, you mentioned in your note about who you are and what you&#8217;re doing that you&#8217;re helping with testing not only in the test section in the Test Team but then also across the project. So, I have a follow-up question for you. What can developers do to create better tests for their software?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:06:18]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are sections within the Core handbook that kind of go into detail about the types of tests that should accompany individual contributions. A lot of those require kind of an extra step, and some developers maybe don&#8217;t have as much experience there. So hopefully, the Core handbook can provide a little bit of that guidance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a lot of contributors who are interested in things such as unit testing, E2E testing, which is end-to-end testing, and testing in JavaScript or in PHP. So there&#8217;s a wide variety of the types of tests that you can actually contribute to. And I would say maybe about 50% of the tickets that I&#8217;ve triaged, personally, the contributor who brought in the patch was unable to or was not familiar with providing unit tests. So that is a very good opportunity for someone to come in who maybe is not as well versed in the depth of what the patch was involved with. But by contributing a user test, they get an opportunity to look very focused at a particular piece of code, what was modified, and then create unit tests based on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:07:40]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then once that unit test has been submitted and starting to be reviewed, other reviewers, Core contributors, or Core committers, I would say, they&#8217;ll start looking at that and if there are additional details that should be there, expanding the tests or little modifications. Then that also is feedback to that test contributor so that the next time they come in, they&#8217;re more prepared for it. They&#8217;re learning more about Core, and eventually, maybe they&#8217;ll also become a Core contributor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:07]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent. We will include links to these handbook pages and documentation in the show notes if you&#8217;re listening to the podcast on your favorite podcasting platform, Pocketcasts, or it&#8217;s somewhere else. I don&#8217;t know where people listen to podcasts, but if you&#8217;re listening to it somewhere that&#8217;s not on the website, you can come to get that on wordpress.org/news.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, the next question that I have, and I think this is for both of you, Brian, it sounds like you partially answered it, but I bet there are more answers from Anne as well. What advice do you have for those submitting bug reports?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:08:38]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll chime in to start, and then Brian, I&#8217;d love to hear your unique take because I also think you do an excellent job whenever I&#8217;ve engaged with you in various places of providing really good replication steps. And so I love that, and I wanna offer things specific to WordPress itself and something that I&#8217;ve noticed that&#8217;s more cultural rather than necessarily like steps to follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of the things I&#8217;ve noticed that I think has started to come up partially with Covid is people, you know, you start talking at WordCamps or at a meetup, and a bug comes up, and you find someone who knows where to put it, and that kind of connection is has been frayed in the last couple years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so one of the things I feel like I&#8217;ve been saying to a lot of different people at this unique point in time is that it doesn&#8217;t need to be perfect. Don&#8217;t let perfect be the enemy of good. And so if it means you just need to drop it in a Slack channel and you just are like, I don&#8217;t know where to put this, that&#8217;s huge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to hear from people across the project. And I just really encourage anyone, even if you don&#8217;t have the complete information or you&#8217;re not a hundred percent sure you&#8217;re afraid it&#8217;s been reported 10 times before, like, please still report it because we need those reports and also if 10 people reported it and it&#8217;s still not fixed, that also means we need to iterate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:09:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that&#8217;s one of the things, especially with the Full Site Editing outreach program, I feel people will message me saying, hey, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard this a bunch, but… And sometimes I&#8217;ve never heard it at all. And I shudder to think of all the people who have not reached out or have not posted in GitHub or Trac or wherever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, share, and write blog posts. I think that another great way that people can give feedback is if you don&#8217;t know how to get into the depths of WordPress, writing a post and talking about it and sharing it on social media is also a great way to get attention. I read a lot of those. But as much as possible, getting to, if you can, if you&#8217;re comfortable, getting to the source where we&#8217;re able to see it in Github or Trac goes a really long way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And share as much as you can. And don&#8217;t worry if you can&#8217;t spend hours writing the perfect bug report, we still wanna hear from you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:10:21]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Building off of what Anne said, just the fact that you&#8217;re speaking out and raising an issue is a huge step for many, many people. And once, once you&#8217;ve actually done that, as Anne said, it doesn&#8217;t need to be perfect. There are a lot of other people who are going to be looking at these bugs, trying to figure out the replication steps used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So even if you can&#8217;t provide all this detail up front, someone will help. On the back end, they&#8217;ll help kind of fill in those gaps. If you do have the time to actually get deep into providing a very detailed bug report, then there are some key aspects of the bug report that make it very helpful for contributors, not only testers, who should be able to reproduce the issue to validate and make sure that this isn&#8217;t something that&#8217;s unique, unique to a plugin, to a custom theme or snippet that you dropped into your functions PHP.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, also for the actual Core contributors, who then need to be able to understand what is happening so that they can fix the right thing. And some of those items are the information about your testing environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:11:34]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that could be your browser, your server, the type, whether it&#8217;s Apache, Nginx, et cetera, the operating system you&#8217;re running, what version of PHP you&#8217;re running, the version of WordPress, very critical, and…&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:49]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Super important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:11:51]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any themes and plugins that you&#8217;re using. And that kind of information helps set the stage, and then other people will be able to set up their environment similarly if they&#8217;re going to try to test it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After you have provided the environmental information, the steps required to reproduce the issue should be as detailed as possible. You may not have realized that clicking this caused such and such to happen, so just try to remember, or maybe even walk through if it&#8217;s something you can repeat multiple times, walk through a couple of times and write down everything that you&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:12:30]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that you&#8217;re sure, hey, this is the way that I can reproduce this bug. And then those steps will be very helpful for other contributors when they&#8217;re reviewing it. And then it&#8217;s also very helpful if you have video, screenshots, debug logs, any of those other kinds of resources that you could refer to because not all bugs are easy to explain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we tend to… Trac and GitHub issues for the Gutenberg project, everybody&#8217;s writing in English. And maybe your main language is not English, and it might be a little bit challenging to do that. So providing a video, it&#8217;s worth a thousand words in any language. So, if you can provide those types of assets, that&#8217;s also very important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:22]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and I&#8217;ll share a little bit of a you&#8217;re-not-alone-in-it sort of anecdotes from the first few bugs that I ever filed for WordPress. I sort of had this feeling that if I were to file a bug, everyone would know that I wasn&#8217;t a developer. And like everyone knows, I&#8217;m not a developer, but a little bit I was like, they&#8217;ll know now. And so if that&#8217;s where you are also,&nbsp; Anne said it, and Brian said it as well, like, we can&#8217;t fix things that we don&#8217;t realize are broken. And just because you&#8217;ve run into it 15 times, which obviously should never happen, you should run into it once, and then we know, but it happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you run into it 15 times, probably other people have as well. And if it&#8217;s still not fixed, it might be because no one has thought to themselves I should tell someone that&#8217;s broken. And so if that&#8217;s your primary hurdle, folks out there in our listening space, I was once there too. And honestly, knowing that it&#8217;s a problem is as valuable as knowing the solution to it most of the time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:14:23]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and those are, I wanted to add, there is a lot to that to remember. That&#8217;s a lot to remember in terms of what you should be submitting, what, or I should say, what would be ideal in what you&#8217;re submitting. But luckily, in the test handbook, there&#8217;s a test report section, and it includes a description, it goes everything from, it starts with why we do bug reports to examples of the types of testing, whether it be for bugs or enhancements, which also need testing, and it has templates in there that you can copy and paste directly into Trac. And that&#8217;s very helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah,, we will have links to those in the show notes as well. Since we&#8217;re right there at that moment, what do you think we could do as WordPress to make reporting problems easier?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:15:15]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that this has been something that&#8217;s come up during our weekly meetings, discussions on the Core test channel, as well as in contributor day test table discussions. And the test documentation that&#8217;s on the website is a little bit fragmented. I believe that the current test handbook was originally written for a type of flow analysis and feedback testing that is not the norm today. So it&#8217;s a little bit confusing. The terminology is a little dated, and the most recent updates that have been provided on there relate solely to Gutenberg, which is very important that that also be represented, but, in order to find information about testing and Trac or PHP unit tests, you have to go over to the core handbook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we could definitely make things improved by consolidating, bringing everything into one area so that if you are interested in testing, you&#8217;ll have everything in one place and not be split between that and not have outdated methodologies that are asking you to submit videos that nobody&#8217;s going to really look at because we&#8217;re not doing the flow tests anymore. So I think that that would be a benefit to future testers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:16:41]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne, any thoughts?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:16:43]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I&#8217;ll also add that I think there are like two things we can do. One is, there&#8217;s so much happening in the WordPress project in such a cool way that I think the more we can write targeted tests and talk to people about, like, hey, here&#8217;s this new thing coming. This is a high-impact area to test. It&#8217;s under active iteration. You&#8217;re gonna get a lot of engagement. People are really thinking about this and pulling people into that where you kind of get the momentum of getting the feedback in right when someone needs it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we could do that a bit more to make reporting problems easier because it&#8217;s kind of like you&#8217;re in the thick of it with a lot of people rather than maybe exploring an area where someone hasn&#8217;t looked at it in a minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that’s the thing that comes to mind is just the more we can take the time. I think this release cycle has been really good with that, where there&#8217;s been a call for testing for fluid typography. There&#8217;s also been one for using block template parts and classic themes. And there&#8217;s a ton of stuff that&#8217;s been happening where we can kind of make these both developer and more end user testing experiences easier and better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Brian has done a great job continuing the tradition of, you know, helping test this latest release cycle. And he&#8217;s taken those posts and done an amazing job of helping, having specific testing as well. Tied to this, I think just this has always been a thing but better, easier testing environments for developers and for quickly setting up more WordPress sites to test things for end users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:17:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Another thing that we have been discussing in Slack in the Core and Core Test channels is the possibility of pre-populating the Trac tickets. With a template based on what it is that you&#8217;re reporting. So similar to copying a template for a test report out of the handbook. Instead, you would hit a button to say the type of bug you are submitting, and then it would pre-populate that, and then you could fill in the gaps for that. This already happens over in Gutenberg. There, there are templates, and I find that that is very helpful. And so being able to do that in Trac would be useful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then for reporting problems on the user side, I thought that it would be interesting to have like you have for any other modern app, a button that says Report Bug in WordPress that could capture some intelligence data for your installation, the page that you&#8217;re on and have a simple text box where you could provide a little description and then submit that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:19:08]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, these wouldn&#8217;t be the types of things that would just go straight into Trac, most likely. However, it would be an opportunity to allow end users to just send something in, and start having it looked at, rather than looking and saying, okay, I found a bug in WordPress. Now, what do I do?&nbsp; And then not reporting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that would be the worst case is that the bug just doesn&#8217;t get reported. So that would be information that is already harvested if you go to your site health screen and your WordPress installation. A lot of that information that would be useful is there. In this type of bug report, we would want to anonymize and strip a lot of that information out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of private stuff you don&#8217;t wanna share, but there is that data there that&#8217;s available that could potentially help in doing a bug report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:19:57]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brilliant. All right. Question for everyone in the room: what opportunities are there currently to help with testing? Anne, I know, and you already mentioned a few, we can just bombard everybody with links to the tests if we want. But yeah, what opportunities are currently out there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:20:13]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;ll mention the Full Site Editing outreach program. I&#8217;m very biased, but we&#8217;re always looking for new folks. We just crossed, I think, 600 people, which was unbelievable. So even if you&#8217;re not necessarily always able to help join the calls for testing, you can always pop into the FSE outreach experiment channel, which we&#8217;ll also add a link to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s just a great way when you have time to join because I flag stuff all the time, whether it&#8217;s about the outreach program or just in general across the project. Brian does really good weekly round-up testing posts as well. So make.wordpress.org/test is also a great place to get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then right now, I think when this comes out, will be a great time to be helping test WordPress 6.1. So check out that post. I kind of wanna just shove everyone in that direction currently cause I think that&#8217;s the most high-impact thing to get involved with and one of the great ways to give back to the next version of WordPress to make it really delightful and easy to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m just gonna leave it there, even though there are so many ways you can help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:21:11]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.1 coming out on November 1st if you haven&#8217;t yet heard about it. Brian, what else have you got out there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:21:16]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the online stuff, Anne covered that pretty well. I would say if you have a local WordCamp, sign up for their contributor day or if there are any local WordPress meetups. When Covid ended up hitting and lockdowns were rolled out, a lot of this stuff started to really slow down. So I think now is a good time to maybe introduce the idea for, hey, let&#8217;s have a local meetup, and for a couple of hours, we&#8217;ll just do some testing, and look at some stuff in WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it might be a good way of getting people re-engaged. It&#8217;s a little bit lighter weight if you&#8217;re doing testing versus trying to actually provide a patch to fix an issue. So, might be a good way of bringing in some new faces and re-engaging people who we lost over the lockdown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:22:09]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and if you all have never done a testing party for WordPress before, and it sounds like it&#8217;s maybe a really boring thing, it&#8217;s actually not, she said with strong authority and opinions. But also, I have never had a more successful learning experience with the WordPress CMS than when I was trying to figure it out with other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They see things that you don&#8217;t see, they know things you don&#8217;t know, and it really covers a lot of the bases for unknown unknowns when you&#8217;re trying to learn something. And then also you have all these people that like, we’re really in it with you, and everyone&#8217;s really pulling for each other, and it&#8217;s actually a bit more fun than it sounds like when you&#8217;re just like, a testing party. It turns into just like jointly solving a puzzle together, which I think sounds like a lot of fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like a party, but for technology, I would feel this way. I am a mad extrovert, and we all know it, but. Now you two know it as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:23:08]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a final, just like a fun question for you both, and if you have an answer, great. And if you don&#8217;t have an answer, I would be surprised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here we go. Last question of the day. If five more volunteers suddenly appeared to help on the Test Team, what would they do? Just, I waved a magic wand. I guess that&#8217;s what made it fun. I don&#8217;t know why. I was like, fun question and then I&#8217;m, like, assigned tasks that, Yeah, I waved a magic wand. That&#8217;s what made it fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:23:38]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I would say I would probably point them to FSE outreach program posts because…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:23:45]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Woot woot.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:23:47]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>…the outreach program does a great job of outlining steps. You&#8217;re isolating testing in one particular area. It&#8217;s got a lot of tests. There&#8217;s examples of the types of feedback that you&#8217;re looking for, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a really good introduction to it, and most FSE testing does not require a local dev environment. Which is probably the biggest hurdle for a new tester coming in. If you do have developers with more experience, then they could start–and they wanted to look into Trac tickets or GitHub issues– then it does take a little bit of setup and you may spend the next few hours configuring your development environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So instead, I would recommend that you start with something like FSE outreach program posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:24:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did not pay Brian to say that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:24:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re just all partial to it here. That&#8217;s all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:24:45]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, we really are. Yeah, no, this is, I love this question, and I actually find it really fun cause I think about it a lot. And we&#8217;ve talked about some of this stuff too, and it&#8217;s something that when I think about five more people suddenly appearing, makes me giddy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we have folks, who have helped with like, I think I&#8217;ve mentioned like translations and group testing and even responding to questions that come from the channel and like, I just wish if we had five folks full time dedicated to that, I could see way more hallway hangouts where we casually talk about stuff and actually go on a call and talk live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could see folks, someone dedicated to helping translations and translating even more places. We have an Italian contributor who does it regularly, and a couple of Japanese contributors every once in awhile we get Spanish translation. But I&#8217;d love to see more translations to bring more people in, more facilitating group testing, more types of testing, helping me be more creative because sometimes I get a creative wall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But more than anything, if I really think long term about the project and thinking about this outreach program model, which I don&#8217;t think I fully appreciated how new it was, Josepha, when you introduced the idea, I think it would be so neat to bring in more folks to actually create new outreach programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:25:52]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So maybe there&#8217;s an outreach program for theme authors or block theme authors, or maybe there&#8217;s an outreach program around collaborative editing. Like what does this look like, and how can we expand this to bring more people in? And I think a lot of that will prove the resiliency and lessons we&#8217;ve learned from Covid in the WordPress community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can&#8217;t necessarily always rely on the meetup groups, so how can we meet people where they are? And I think there&#8217;s something really interesting and almost serendipitous that the outreach program started literally, I think it was like May 2020, like a couple of months into the pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I, like, I want to see it in a position of strength where we both have the in-person community alongside this outreach program model that can intertwine work. And I&#8217;d love to see the model expand to different types. And right now, maybe part of that is we use the outreach program model, the full site editing outreach program group itself, to experiment more and to keep that level of experimentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s something I feel really strongly about is continuing to find what works and what doesn&#8217;t. And so if we had five more people, I could just, I&#8217;d probably go wild and have all sorts of cool, cool things and spinoffs, but I&#8217;m more introverted than Josepha, so there&#8217;s limitations to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:26:56]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, you heard it here first. If you&#8217;re one of my 6,000 listeners. I only need five of one of you. Five of the ones of you to come and make Anne&#8217;s whole life an exciting joy for the next 12 months. So, I only need five of you and I know that you&#8217;re out there. There are 2000 or something, 6,000. I have no idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got more than 1000 of you listening, and I know that you wanna come and help Anne cuz she&#8217;s a delight. I know you wanna come help Brian cuz he&#8217;s a delight. Both of you. This was such a fun conversation. Thank you for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:27:29]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you, Josepha. Thank you, Anne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:27:31]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:27:33]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there it is a bit of a deep dive on the Test Team and how to get started on it. Like I mentioned, we&#8217;ll have a ton of links in the show notes over on wordpress.org/news. And I wanna remind folks that if you have questions or thoughts that you&#8217;d like to hear from me about, you can always email us at WPbriefing@wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:27:58]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. First and foremost, we are counting down the days to the WordPress 6.1 release. We are within a month of the target release date. So if you have not tested the latest version with your plugins or themes, now is the time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, we are seeing translated tutorials being submitted on learn.wordpress.org. I&#8217;m delighted to see that happening, and I encourage any polyglots out there who feel called to consider translating one into your language and help other people feel empowered to use WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing is that the WordPress Speaker Workshop for Women Voices in India just concluded, so to celebrate, we&#8217;ve opened registrations for the WordPress Speaker Workshop for Women Voices in Latin America. Unlike the last one, this event takes place in person on October 29th. And so I&#8217;ll include a link to registrations for that in the show notes as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.

Important (and some familiar) questions are emerging as this story unfolds: how to balance the values of openness, security, and privacy as well as cooperation and competition at WordPress.org — still the central hub for WordPress plugin businesses. </p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">On September 29, changesets <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/12097\">12097</a> and <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/12098\">12098</a> were committed to the Meta Trac repository for wordpress.org by Scott Reilly (Audrey Capital). These changes remove the Active Install Growth chart from the plugin repository\'s &#8220;Advanced&#8221; section on individual plugins. The only explanation given by Scott is &#8220;insufficient data obfuscation.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These changes are simply a reversion of the code that Alex Shiels (Automattic) added  to create the section with active install data back in 2017. Alex\'s ticket for improvements to the &#8220;Advanced&#8221; view (#<a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3016\">3106</a>) includes other additions to public plugin data that were never implemented due to concerns over the potential for them to be &#8220;gamed.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-plugin-owners-respond\">Plugin Owners Respond</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On September 30, Mark Zahra opened Trac ticket #<a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511\">6511</a> &#8220;Bring back the active install growth chart&#8221; to express its importance to plugin owners and to request improvements rather than deletion. Discussions were already taking place in Make WordPress #<a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1664524515185589\">meta</a>, on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markzahra/status/1576337548502528000\">Twitter</a>, and in Post Status #<a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/C0413T6GD/p1664528945421999\">business</a>, where Mark shared his ticket. At Post Status, a discussion was already happening about the challenges of entering the plugin repo and succeeding there since Vito Peleg had just launched Atarim\'s freemium <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/atarim-visual-collaboration/\">Visual Collaboration</a> plugin at wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Abuse Comes to Light But Details Aren\'t Clear Yet</h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>For some time now, it\'s been a common and reasonable assumption in the WordPress business community that some of the bigger plugin owners have very accurate data on their plugins\' usage as well as their competitors — enough to create a &#8220;leaderboard&#8221; to assess the effectiveness of sales campaigns or to see a buying opportunity in others\' declining install figures.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Abuse of the active install growth chart has been an issue in the past. Barış Ünver\'s article, <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/the-decline-of-speed-booster-pack/\">The Decline of Speed Booster Pack</a>, touches on an incident where several hundred plugins had their install stats artificially inflated, mostly to mask the perpetrator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abuse seems to be an issue again but of a different type. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha Haden Chomphosy joined the #meta discussion and said Marius Jensen was approximately correct in guessing &#8220;the active install growth could be (was being?) used to determine near exact numbers, making the intended obfuscation pointless.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The data shared is always a bit obfuscated so that it’s harder to “game the system” — the same reason we don’t have running leaderboards for contributions.</p><cite>Josepha haden Chomphosy &lt;<a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1664559896577109\">https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1664559896577109</a>&gt;</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Security or Privacy? Or Security <em>and</em> Privacy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In reply to Mark\'s ticket, John James Jacoby affirmed there had been, <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3016#comment:12\">in Michael Nelson\'s words</a>, a &#8220;closed-door security or privacy decision taken by a larger group.&#8221; The active install growth charts were not pulled on a whim by a single individual.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sponsored by Awesome Motive, John is a full-time contributor to the Core, Documentation, and Meta teams. He says he independently reviewed the code generating the data for the active install chart which he noted &#8220;is outside of the Meta repository&#8221; with other &#8220;code  responsible for keeping WordPress.org running.&#8221; None of this code is &#8220;publicly available,&#8221; but he &#8220;independently identified precisely why these charts were removed the way that they were,&#8221; and he &#8220;would not have made any different decisions had [he] been in on the decision-making process.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John added he doesn\'t &#8220;have any doubts that [improvement and not removal] is the long-term goal&#8221; for the active install growth chart. Further, he added that fast, private action was called for and &#8220;is not intended to hurt your community of users.&#8221; Instead, the intention is to &#8220;[exclude] many people to protect them from some people.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later, in #Meta, John specified two future options for the return of Active Install data:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Private by default, and optionally made public by plugin authors on a per-plugin basis.</p><p>A GUI could be invented to allow plugin authors to add usernames with access to the stats, similar to how it works for the support forums.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Active Install Data Matters </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Active installs are the only way plugin owners can estimate the number of sites that are using their free plugin — and assess growth or decline over time. As Joost de Valk noted on Mark\'s ticket, &#8220;The <em>trends</em> in this data are <strong>super</strong> important for plugin developers, as seen by the many many people that have responded to <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1664525003424199\">this in [WordPress] Slack</a>.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By monitoring many plugins across the repo, <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/are-active-installs-of-wordpress-plugins-declining-in-2021/\">market trends can be assessed</a> as well. Doing this work manually for even a single plugin is <a href=\"https://benjaminintal.com/2020/09/12/how-to-get-the-actual-number-of-active-installs-of-your-wordpress-plugin/\">quite a chore</a>. Iain Poulson, who is now at WP Engine, <a href=\"https://pluginrank.com/true-active-installs-and-more/\">automated and improved on</a> that process for Plugin Rank, which is now an Awesome Motive product. wpMetric offers <a href=\"https://wpmetrics.dev/blog/plugin-actual-active-installs\">a similar analysis</a>. So does WPDesk\'s <a href=\"https://activeinstalls.com/\">Active Installs</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some time now, it\'s been a common and reasonable assumption in the WordPress business community that some of the bigger plugin owners have very accurate data on their (and their competitors\') plugins\' usage — enough to create a &#8220;leaderboard&#8221; to assess the effectiveness of sales campaigns or see a buying opportunity in others\' declining install figures. Josepha and John are clearly opposed to that happening, certainly in a public way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Healthy Co-opetition Is Not a Leaderboard</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Reflecting on some early BuddyPress history, John shared how that project\'s &#8220;original primary concern&#8221; had been:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8230;revealing active install charts & graphs for all plugins & themes may not actually be healthy for the entire community, because it is impossible to resist using that single number to speculate about things those numbers may or may not imply – quality, security, performance, earnings, success, etc&#8230; and when that scales to inevitably comparing data across multiple plugins & themes, is any of that actually healthy, positive, or a real goal?</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>John also addressed Joost\'s sharpest criticism that &#8220;Automattic has an unfair competitive advantage because they have access to more accurate stats,&#8221; while everyone else is now fully in the dark. (Joost made this claim on several channels, and  it\'s a continuing thread in #<a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02QB8GMM/p1664620909150329\">meta</a>.) </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I will go one step farther and say, that if a goal with any data is to be fair to each other with it, that includes a responsibility to serve up the same data with the same interface to everyone, and to <em>prevent people from accessing it in any way that is unintended or unfair</em>.<br /><br />&#8230;which is essentially what has happened, here.</p><cite>JJJ &lt;<a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511#comment:5\">https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511#comment:5</a>&gt;</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Open to all — <em>for all who want to be open</em> — seems to be the way the issue will be resolved, probably to a near consensus. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But will enough data be available to satisfy those who feel like &#8220;Second-Class Third-Party Developers,&#8221; as Iain Poulson put it <a href=\"https://s.wptrends.co/w/kWJrSn4PAY2Xziux1YiYEQ\">in his WP Trends newsletter this morning</a>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The deepest issues will likely remain divisive — perceived competitive advantages, the definition of healthy competition in an open source ecosystem, and who gets to referee these things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha emphasized that &#8220;suggestions are welcome for how to get some data for you all while doing our best to stick with a &#8216;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coopetition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">co-opetition</a>&#8216; mindset.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511\">Reply on Mark\'s ticket</a> if you have helpful contributions to make toward that goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-44 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 id=\"questions\">Worthwhile questions that (re-)emerged in these events:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Can active install data collection be improved and explained</strong> sufficiently to indicate what it measures and how accurate it is — without revealing too much information that could be abused? What is the best balance of care, openness, and awareness that abuse will always happen, sooner or later?</li><li><strong>Can decisions like pulling active install data (along with the people and processes involved in those decisions) be more transparent</strong> and publicly defined to avoid the confusion, injury, and distrust that often results? As a matter of internal public relations, could there be people tasked with explaining delicate issues that can\'t (immediately) be explained fully in a public way? (As opposed to hints and guesses in Slack.)</li><li><strong>Same question for WordPress.org #forum policies</strong> on moderation, reviews, replies to reviews, and other things plugin owners care about. Without being too open (due to the risk of &#8220;gaming&#8221;), can clearer guidance be given to onboard new plugin owners at .org? E.g, how reviews are validated, why they may be removed, and how to appeal their removal? Or how plugin owners and their support staff should avoid or deal with being put under moderation?</li><li><strong>What are winning growth strategies for plugin owners </strong>that aren\'t dependent or overly focused on single measures of success — whether they use the .org repo or not? What are the best ways to go all-in with .org? Or is that simply a mistake?</li><li><strong>How does/doesn\'t the inclusion of all wp.org plugins in the new wp.com marketplace affect active install stats?</strong> Are these combined or separate numbers? What data is available from wp.com to free and commercial plugin owners about their installs there?</li></ul>\n</div></div>\n</div><p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 03 Oct 2022 05:01:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"<span class=\'p-author h-card\'>Dan Knauss</span>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:121:\"Gutenberg Times: Content-only editing for patterns, Learn to use Data Layer in WordPress and more – Weekend Edition 231\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=22274\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:127:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/content-only-editing-for-patterns-learn-to-use-data-layer-in-wordpress-and-more-weekend-edition-231/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:17063:\"<p>Howdy, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for the check-ins after Hurricane Ian aimed for Southwest Florida, and made landfall on Wednesday.

They could all user your input on how things could be improved for the content creator and site builder.

It is one of the most exciting features of the release and one that has long been on my personal wish-list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past couple of weeks, I&#8217;ve been doing a deep dive into this new feature, wondering how it could fit into real-world projects. My conclusion was:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>If building a new classic theme from scratch, block template parts should be relatively easy to insert into it.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If adding block template parts into a classic theme, there are likely a few hurdles that you&#8217;ll need clear, hoops to jump through, and even potential mountains to climb.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The latter is what this tutorial will focus on. There are 1,000s of classic themes out there in the wild, and the most likely use case for this feature will be the developers who are gradually adopting FSE features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that use case in mind, I picked a battle-tested classic theme that is still somewhat recent: Twenty Twenty-One. It already had some of the foundational pieces, such as supporting the block-based content editor. However, it didn&#8217;t have support for newer FSE features, such as <code>theme.json</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other goal for this walk-through was to show a more advanced use case rather than only cover the basics. Ultimately, this helped reveal some of the issues theme authors might face as they go on this journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, I created hero header for Twenty Twenty-One that provides users a ton of flexibility for customizing its output on the front end:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-constrained wp-block-group has-light-background-background-color has-background\">\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">Table of Contents</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-sortabrilliant-guidepost\"><ul><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#0-setting-the-groundwork\">Setting the Groundwork</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#1-clearing-those-hurdles\">Clearing Those Hurdles</a><ul><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#2-adding-theme-json-support\">Adding theme.json Support</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#3-style-overrides\">Style Overrides</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#4-building-a-block-header-template-part\">Building a Block Header Template Part</a><ul><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#5-inserting-branding-and-navigation\">Inserting Branding and Navigation</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#6-extra-locking-blocks\">Extra: Locking Blocks</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#7-copying-the-header-part-to-the-theme\">Copying the Header Part to the Theme</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#8-leveling-up-with-patterns-and-media\">Leveling Up With Patterns and Media</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#9-cleaning-up-the-user-experience\">Cleaning Up the User Experience</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#10-resources-to-learn-more\">Resources To Learn More</a></li></ul></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<img />Hero header built with a block template part.\n\n\n\n<p>I invite you to come along with me down this path. I did all of the hard work ahead of time in hopes that it will help those of you who want to give this new feature a try.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d rather skip the walk-through and dive right into the code, no worries. I extracted everything I am covering into this tutorial and put it in a child theme named <a href=\"https://github.com/justintadlock/tt1-block-parts\">TT1 Block Parts</a>. Child themes are an easy way to test features without directly changing the parent theme, so I encourage going that route too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"0-setting-the-groundwork\">Setting the Groundwork</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This feature will be available as part of the WordPress 6.1 release.  To test it now, you must either install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/09/wordpress-6-1-beta-2-now-available/\">WordPress 6.1 Beta 2</a> or the latest version of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg\">Gutenberg plugin</a>.  You will also need a classic theme active on your site.  Use <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentyone/\">Twenty Twenty-One</a> to follow along with each step exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before building a block-based template part in a classic theme, you must enable the feature via the <code>block-template-parts</code> theme-support flag in your theme&#8217;s <code>functions.php</code> file.</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs language-php\"><span class=\"hljs-meta\">&lt;?php</span>\nadd_action( <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'after_setup_theme\'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'tt1_block_parts_setup\'</span> );\n\n<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">tt1_block_parts_setup</span><span class=\"hljs-params\">()</span> </span>{\n    add_theme_support( <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'block-template-parts\'</span> );\n}</code></div><small class=\"shcb-language\" id=\"shcb-language-6\"><span class=\"shcb-language__label\">Code language:</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__name\">PHP</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">(</span><span class=\"shcb-language__slug\">php</span><span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<p>This code will create a new <em>Appearance &gt; Template Parts</em> page in the WordPress admin:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Initial template parts screen when no parts are registered.\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, it&#8217;s empty, but you and your users will be able to customize any existing block template parts from this screen once you&#8217;ve created them. Let&#8217;s do that now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next step is building a header template part, which will live in the theme&#8217;s <code>parts</code> folder (this is where all block template parts go). The easiest way to get started is to create an empty <code>parts/header.html</code> file. We&#8217;ll build this out from the site editor in the next steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, we need to replace Twenty Twenty-One&#8217;s header with our custom one. Open the theme&#8217;s <code>header.php</code> template and find this line of code:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs language-php\"><span class=\"hljs-meta\">&lt;?php</span> get_template_part( <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'template-parts/header/site-header\'</span> ); <span class=\"hljs-meta\">?&gt;</span></code></div><small class=\"shcb-language\" id=\"shcb-language-7\"><span class=\"shcb-language__label\">Code language:</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__name\">PHP</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">(</span><span class=\"shcb-language__slug\">php</span><span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<p>Replace it with the following:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs language-php\"><span class=\"hljs-meta\">&lt;?php</span> block_template_part( <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'header\'</span> ); <span class=\"hljs-meta\">?&gt;</span></code></div><small class=\"shcb-language\" id=\"shcb-language-8\"><span class=\"shcb-language__label\">Code language:</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__name\">PHP</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">(</span><span class=\"shcb-language__slug\">php</span><span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<p>It won&#8217;t be that easy with every theme. Fortunately, Twenty Twenty-One already separated its primary template code into a PHP-based template part, so we merely needed to change one function call with another. For other themes, it may require removing large chunks of code. It just depends on the theme itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"1-clearing-those-hurdles\">Clearing Those Hurdles</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most classic themes were simply not designed to handle blocks outside the content area. This is even true of Twenty Twenty-One because the block-based template editor didn&#8217;t exist when it was created.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each theme is unique, so there is no way for me to realistically foretell what sort of adventures you might go on to get block template parts to work. However, what I can tell you is what I changed with Twenty Twenty-One.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal here is transparency rather than glossing over those very likely hurdles you&#8217;ll need to jump, but do not let them scare you away.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-adding-theme-json-support\">Adding theme.json Support</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on my tests with Twenty Twenty-One and other themes, <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/theme-json/\">opting into <code>theme.json</code></a> was almost a must-have. I had the most most success by configuring <code>settings.layout</code> to support wide/full alignments (I used existing CSS properties from the theme for this). I also needed <code>settings.spacing.blockGap</code> to have control over the spacing between menu items in the Navigation block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that in mind, I strongly recommend starting with a simple <code>theme.json</code> file in your theme, assuming it doesn&#8217;t already have one:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs language-json\">{\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"version\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">2</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"settings\"</span>: {\n        <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"layout\"</span>: {\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"contentSize\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"var( --responsive--default-width )\"</span>,\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"wideSize\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"var( --responsive--alignwide-width )\"</span>\n        },\n        <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"spacing\"</span>: {\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"blockGap\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-literal\">true</span>\n        }\n    }\n}</code></div><small class=\"shcb-language\" id=\"shcb-language-9\"><span class=\"shcb-language__label\">Code language:</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__name\">JSON / JSON with Comments</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">(</span><span class=\"shcb-language__slug\">json</span><span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"3-style-overrides\">Style Overrides</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I also had to make a few CSS overrides (editor and front end) so that everything was a bit less wonky. Remember, we&#8217;re pushing blocks into a place they have never been before in the theme, so some adjustments are a given.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following CSS is all that was needed to make the block template part work. The most time-consuming aspect was tracking this stuff down in a theme that I wasn&#8217;t particularly knowledgeable of.</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs language-css\"><span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.wp-block-navigation</span><span class=\"hljs-selector-pseudo\">:not(.has-background)</span> <span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.wp-block-navigation__container</span> {\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">background</span>: transparent;\n}\n\n<span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.wp-block-cover__inner-container</span> &gt; * {\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">max-width</span>: none <span class=\"hljs-meta\">!important</span>;\n}\n\n<span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.wp-block</span> {\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">max-width</span>: none;\n}\n\n<span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.wp-block-cover</span> <span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.wp-block-site-title</span><span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.has-text-color</span> <span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">a</span> {\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">color</span>: inherit;\n}\n\n<span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.is-root-container</span> &gt; <span class=\"hljs-selector-pseudo\">:first-child</span> {\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">margin-top</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>;\n}</code></div><small class=\"shcb-language\" id=\"shcb-language-10\"><span class=\"shcb-language__label\">Code language:</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__name\">CSS</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">(</span><span class=\"shcb-language__slug\">css</span><span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"4-building-a-block-header-template-part\">Building a Block Header Template Part</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get to the more advanced, media-based version of a header template part, let&#8217;s stick with the basics. I promise to cover some of the fun stuff as we move along. For now, <em>let&#8217;s learn to crawl before attempting to walk.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Go back to the <em>Appearance &gt; Template Parts</em> screen in the WordPress admin that you created in the first step. Click on the &#8220;header&#8221; template part, which will take you to the template editor. You should see an empty canvas on which to place your creation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started with a Cover block. It&#8217;s a simple starting point but one of the most flexible blocks in WordPress, providing end-users with tons of customization options out of the gate.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding a Cover block to the Header template part.\n\n\n\n<p>I kept my block settings simple and selected the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Overlay Color: The theme&#8217;s default gray</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Overlay Opacity: 100</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"5-inserting-branding-and-navigation\">Inserting Branding and Navigation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to keep Twenty Twenty-One&#8217;s default header elements in place, which meant recreating the theme&#8217;s branding and navigation menu while not going overboard with additional elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To achieve this, I added a 50/50 Columns block (the widths of these could be adjusted). In the left column, I inserted Stack with Site Title and Site Tagline. On the right, I placed a Navigation block.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding branding and a navigation menu.\n\n\n\n<p>The individual settings for these blocks are not particularly important. You can customize them to your liking. The most vital ones are likely justifying the Stack block left and Navigation block right. I also bumped up the block spacing to space out the nav menu items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where you can have a lot of fun, and I don&#8217;t want to spoil it with a step-by-step guide on what stylistic settings to choose. <em>Experiment. Go wild!</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"6-extra-locking-blocks\">Extra: Locking Blocks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my favorite tools as a theme author is the ability to lock blocks in place with more complex templates or patterns. One of the primary use cases for this is to prevent end-users from accidentally removing an important block, such as the Site Title, or moving things around and being unable to reconfigure them. The site header is one easiest areas to mess up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the individual Column block wrapping the Site Title and Site Tagline blocks, I selected all three of the currently-available lock settings:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Disable movement</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Prevent removal</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apply to all blocks inside</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img />Locking the header branding Column block and its content.\n\n\n\n<p>I also set a lock on the outer Columns block to prevent users from inadvertently moving or removing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, end-users can unlock a block by clicking the &#8220;lock&#8221; toolbar icon. The extra step primarily serves as a warning to only take this action if they feel comfortable doing so. It&#8217;s possible to even prevent this from the development end, but that&#8217;s outside the scope of this tutorial. To go even more advanced with block locking, take a read the the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/curating-the-editor-experience/\">Curating the Editor Experience</a> documentation and its section on the Locking APIs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"7-copying-the-header-part-to-the-theme\">Copying the Header Part to the Theme</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we built this template part within the editor, all of our customizations are stored in the database.  If planning to distribute this theme to others, you should copy all of the blocks from the editor to your <code>parts/header.html</code> file.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final code for my template part was:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs language-xml\"><span class=\"hljs-comment\">&lt;!-- wp:cover

class=\"shcb-language__slug\">xml</span><span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<p>After saving that file to your theme, you also need to clear your customizations from the database.  You can do this by clicking on the Template Parts admin menu item and selecting the <code>⋮</code> (vertical ellipsis) button for the Header part and clicking the &#8220;Clear customizations&#8221; option.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Clearing customizations from the Header template part.\n\n\n\n<p><em>As you can tell from the above screenshot, I have been tinkering with a lot of template part ideas.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"8-leveling-up-with-patterns-and-media\">Leveling Up With Patterns and Media</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A plain ol&#8217; dark gray header background might not be too exciting. As promised, we&#8217;ll kick this up a notch by integrating with another block-related featured that classic themes can opt into: <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/block-patterns/\">patterns</a>. We&#8217;ll use this to add a video background (or, image, if you prefer).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because block template parts are HTML, it means that you cannot do anything dynamic, such as accurately reference media via your theme&#8217;s URL path. You need PHP to do this. That&#8217;s where patterns come in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of putting all of the block code into <code>parts/header.html</code>, you now only need one line of code:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs language-xml\"><span class=\"hljs-comment\">&lt;!-- wp:pattern {\"slug\":\"tt1-block-parts/header-video\"} /--&gt;</span></code></div><small class=\"shcb-language\" id=\"shcb-language-12\"><span class=\"shcb-language__label\">Code language:</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__name\">HTML, XML</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">(</span><span class=\"shcb-language__slug\">xml</span><span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<p>This references a &#8220;Header Video&#8221; pattern that we will build in these next steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress will automatically register any patterns found in a theme&#8217;s <code>patterns</code> folder. So, the next step is to create a <code>patterns/header-video.php</code> file with a few lines of info:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs language-xml\"><span class=\"php\"><span class=\"hljs-meta\">&lt;?php</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">/*\n * Title: Header - Video\n * Slug: tt1-block-parts/header-video\n * Viewport Width: 1024\n * Categories: header, twentytwentyone\n * Inserter: yes\n */</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-meta\">?&gt;</span></span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">&lt;!-- Replace with block code. --&gt;</span></code></div><small class=\"shcb-language\" id=\"shcb-language-13\"><span class=\"shcb-language__label\">Code language:</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__name\">HTML, XML</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">(</span><span class=\"shcb-language__slug\">xml</span><span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<p>When you&#8217;ve built out your header, just remove the <code>&lt;!-- Replace with block code. --&gt;</code> and put the block HTML code in its place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s jump back to the editor. Using the same header from earlier, we can make a few simple changes to the Cover block to liven things up a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Click the &#8220;Add Media&#8221; toolbar button and select a image or video (your preference).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click the duotone toolbar button to put a filter over the media.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Remove the overlay color and adjust the opacity settings in the block inspector sidebar to your liking.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding a video and duotone filter to the Cover block.\n\n\n\n<p>Now, you need to copy the block code from the editor and paste it into your <code>patterns/header-video.php</code> file. However, there is one important step you must take afterward. You need to change any references to image or video files that look like the following (there may be more than one occurrence):</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs language-javascript\">http:<span class=\"hljs-comment\">//localhost/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/header-bg.mp4</span></code></div><small class=\"shcb-language\" id=\"shcb-language-14\"><span class=\"shcb-language__label\">Code language:</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__name\">JavaScript</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">(</span><span class=\"shcb-language__slug\">javascript</span><span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<p>Those need to reference the media file wherever it lives within your theme. Because I put my header video MP4 into my theme&#8217;s <code>assets/video</code> folder, I changed each reference to the following:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs language-php\"><span class=\"hljs-meta\">&lt;?</span>= esc_url( get_theme_file_uri( <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'assets/video/header-bg.mp4\'</span> ) ) <span

class=\"shcb-language__paren\">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<p>My final <code>patterns/header-video.php</code> code became:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs language-php\"><span class=\"hljs-meta\">&lt;?php</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">/*\n * Title: Header - Video\n * Slug: tt1-block-parts/header-video\n * Viewport Width: 1024\n * Categories:

effect.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"9-cleaning-up-the-user-experience\">Cleaning Up the User Experience</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is one final task that I must ask of you as a theme author. It&#8217;s not required, but it is one of those <em>nice-to-haves</em> that will make the user experience a bit nicer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that <code>theme.json</code> file that we created much earlier in this walk-through? Let&#8217;s add a <code>templateParts</code> section to it and register our custom header. We can add a title for our header template part that can be translated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final <code>theme.json</code> file:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs language-json\">{\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"version\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">2</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"settings\"</span>: {\n        <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"layout\"</span>: {\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"contentSize\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"var( --responsive--default-width )\"</span>,\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"wideSize\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"var( --responsive--alignwide-width )\"</span>\n        },\n        <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"spacing\"</span>: {\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"blockGap\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-literal\">true</span>\n        }\n    },\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"templateParts\"</span>: [\n        {\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"name\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"header\"</span>,\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"title\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Header\"</span>,\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"area\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"header\"</span>\n        }\n    ]\n}</code></div><small class=\"shcb-language\" id=\"shcb-language-17\"><span class=\"shcb-language__label\">Code language:</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__name\">JSON / JSON with Comments</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">(</span><span class=\"shcb-language__slug\">json</span><span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<p>Now everything is nice and polished. Pat yourself on the back for a job well done if you&#8217;ve made it this far. Block-based template parts can be a lot of fun, and they&#8217;ll put a ton of customization power into the hands of your users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"10-resources-to-learn-more\">Resources To Learn More</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/block-based-template-parts-for-classic-themes/\">Block-Based Template Parts: A Happy Medium Between Classic and Block Themes</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/block-themes/converting-a-classic-theme-to-a-block-theme/#gradually-adopting-the-full-site-editing\">Gradually Adopting FSE Features in Classic Themes</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/block-themes/templates-and-template-parts/#block-c5fa39a2-a27d-4bd2-98d0-dc6249a0801a\">Block Template Parts</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-patterns/\">Block Patterns</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/curating-the-editor-experience/#locking-apis\">Curating the Editor Experience: Locking APIs</a></li>\n</ul>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 30 Sep 2022 14:46:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"Post Status: WordPress Careers Roundup for the Week of September 26, 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=126144\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-careers-roundup-for-the-week-of-september-26-2022/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4502:\"<div class=\"e-content\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-41 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-2-color has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">Craft your origin story • Pointed questions for devs to ask prospective employers • Strategies against Ageism • IBM\'s a**hole test • Take a pass on a &#8220;fast-paced environment.&#8221; • WordPress Translation Day • Writing Tips for Engineers • Preventing burnout as a manager </p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Walt Kania</strong> explains why you should <a href=\"https://thefreelancery.com/crafting-your-origin-story/\">craft your origin story</a> over at the <strong>Freelancery</strong>.

For years, theme authors have been enqueuing Google Fonts from the Google CDN for better performance, but this method exposes visitors’ IP addresses. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Themes Team warned that guidelines regarding locally hosting fonts will be changing imminently and many theme authors <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-authors-are-moving-to-host-fonts-locally\">moved to comply</a> before it becomes a requirement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55985\">ticket</a> for bundling Google fonts with WordPress&#8217; legacy default themes had patches and was on track to be included in WordPress 6.1 in November. WordPress contributor Hendrik Luehrsen <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55985#comment:35\">requested</a> more eyes on the ticket, saying it &#8220;directly affects the core WordPress audience in Germany.&#8221; He reported that users in Germany were still getting emails threatening fines for using fonts loaded from Google.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress core committer Tonya Mork <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55985#comment:35\">suggested</a> exploring releasing the updated version of each theme separately from WordPress 6.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When each theme is ready, release it to wp.org&#8217;s theme repo,&#8221; Mork said. &#8220;Users can then update to get locally hosted fonts ahead of when WP 6.1 is released.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This changed the direction of the ticket and with more scrutiny, contributors found the patches could use some more work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Creating new theme versions for this specific change could be good <em>when they are ready</em>,&#8221; Stephen Bernhardt said. &#8220;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2022/07/28/using-locally-hosted-google-fonts-in-themes/\">Using locally hosted fonts</a> is already recommended, but we need to fix our own themes before we can make this a requirement for others.&#8221; He submitted a list of problems and potential improvements after reviewing the patches, and contributors are working on a better approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress core committer David Baumwald <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55985#comment:51\">changed the milestone to 6.2</a>, as Beta 2 for 6.1 was released yesterday and the ticket still needs a final direction and patch. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;While I understand the issue, this is nonetheless sad to see,&#8221; Luehrsen said. &#8220;This is still a serious issue in Germany (and other GDPR territories), as users with active Google Fonts are currently <a href=\"https://www-heise-de.translate.goog/news/DSGVO-Abmahnwelle-wegen-Google-Fonts-7206364.html?_x_tr_sl=de&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=de&_x_tr_pto=wapp\">getting targeted by people exploiting the law</a>.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Luehrsen took to Twitter to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hluehrsen/status/1575035575068856321\">comment</a> on his disappointment with the ticket missing the window for 6.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is the reason why WordPress will probably lose relevance,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Real users get hurt here, but they are in GDPR territories and this does not seem to be important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Could I have done more? Probably. But it is somewhat sad to see how quickly the momentum on that ticket fizzled out. If Squarespace, Wix and sorts start marketing privacy against WordPress, we&#8217;re screwed in GDPR countries.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, those who are using WordPress&#8217; default themes can use a plugin like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/local-google-fonts/\">Local Google Fonts</a> or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/host-webfonts-local/\">OMGF | GDPR/DSVGO Compliant, Faster Google Fonts</a> to host fonts locally. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can also switch to <a href=\"https://fonts.bunny.net/\">Bunny Fonts</a>, an open-source, privacy-first web font platform with no tracking or logging that is fully GDPR compliant. Bunny Fonts is compatible with the Google Fonts CSS v1 API so it can function as a drop-in replacement. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/replace-google-fonts-with-bunny-fonts/\">Replace Google Fonts with Bunny Fonts</a> plugin makes it easy for users to do that without editing any theme code. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors are working on having fully GDPR-compliant WordPress default themes ready for WordPress 6.2, expected in early 2023.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 18:31:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"Akismet: Version 5.0.1 of the Akismet WordPress Plugin is Now Available\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://blog.akismet.com/?p=2426\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"https://blog.akismet.com/2022/09/28/version-5-0-1-of-the-akismet-wordpress-plugin-is-now-available/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:821:\"<p>Version 5.0.1 of <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/\">the Akismet plugin for WordPress</a> is now available.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, how to improve the accessibility of your WordPress website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast, player of choice. Or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m very keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you all your idea featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the contact form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Joe Dolson. Joe is a WordPress plugin developer, a core committer and a web accessibility consultant. He&#8217;s part of the Make WordPress accessibility team, the team dedicated to improving accessibility in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His recent presentation at WordCamp US entitled, finding and fixing the six most common WCAG 2 failures, highlight some of the key areas where websites are not as accessible as they should be. The areas we discuss are, low contrast text, missing alternative text, empty links, missing form labels, empty buttons and missing document language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe explains what each of these problems are, both in terms of how they can be fixed as well as what people with accessibility requirements might experience when they visit your site. We talk about how you can equip yourself with the tools that you need to diagnose these issues and online resources you can use to discover more about website accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s Joe&#8217;s opinion that you&#8217;re better off making a start right now, carrying out incremental changes rather than attempting to solve every single problem that your website might have. Begin the journey and take it one problem at a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also chat about the fact that there&#8217;s an ever-growing legal compulsion to make websites follow accessibility guidelines. Lawsuits are going through the courts with greater regularity. So now might be the time for you to look into this topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, Joe cautions against the use of tools, which purport to solve your accessibility issues with minimal effort. A variety of pop-up solutions have emerged onto the market, which claimed that they can make your site compliant with almost no effort. Joe is adamant that these promises are almost always false and that there&#8217;s real work to be done on each website, as they&#8217;re all unique and have unique problems to solve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically when we record the podcast. There&#8217;s not a lot of background noise. But that&#8217;s not always the case. Over the coming weeks, I&#8217;ll be bringing you recordings from a recent trip to WordCamp US 2022, and you might notice that the recordings have a little echo or other strange audio artifacts. Whilst the podcasts are more than listable, I do hope that you understand that the vagaries of the real world we&#8217;re at play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, and you&#8217;ll find all of the other episodes there as well. And so without further delay, I bring you Joe Dolson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Joe Dolson. Hello Joe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:23] Joe Dolson: Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are at WordCamp, I nearly said WordCamp Europe. We are at WordCamp US 2022. We&#8217;ve got Joe on the podcast today because he is doing a talk at WordCamp US. Do you just wanna tell us a little bit about yourself? Why you&#8217;re on this podcast, but then stray into what your talk is about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:40] Joe Dolson: Certainly So I&#8217;m Joe Dolson. I&#8217;m a WordPress core committer. I&#8217;ve been a contributor to the accessibility of WordPress for quite a long time. I think I first started contributing in WordPress 3.4. I&#8217;d have to look at my history to actually know that for sure, but it was somewhere around there. So today I&#8217;m talking about a study from the nonprofit organization, WebAIM, out of Utah, in which they looked at the top million homepages around the web. The most widely visited, heavily known webpages, and did a bulk analysis of the accessibility issues on those pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, I&#8217;m going to talk about six specific types of errors that they found constituted 96.5% of all detectable errors using automation. And the things that that exposes and how you can work with consultants. How you should use your time and how you should use automation to solve problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:39] Nathan Wrigley: Can I ask how it is that you became interested in accessibility problems, given all the myriad things that you could have become interested in web? How did accessibility fall into your lap and create so much interest for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:51] Joe Dolson: So when I started my business in 2004, I started right from the beginning with the idea that I wanted to pursue accessibility in websites. And that was because when I decided to become a web designer, I wanted something that was unique about what I did. I wanted to do something that wasn&#8217;t just marketing. I wasn&#8217;t really interested in marketing. I&#8217;d seen a lot of that around and I&#8217;m like, boy, that, that just doesn&#8217;t seem like it&#8217;s socially motivating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:21] Nathan Wrigley: Mmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:21] Joe Dolson: It doesn&#8217;t seem like it&#8217;s interesting. It doesn&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m doing something worthwhile. So I had to think to myself about, well, what do I know already? What do I have a unique access to that can make my business be a little bit different? And my mother was the executive director of a nonprofit that provided arts access for people with disabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so for years, I&#8217;d had conversations at home with family when visiting my mother in her workplace about what people with disabilities needed and how the ADA worked, and how all of this sort of world needed to be constructed. So what I already had was a reasonably strong sensibility for why people with disabilities need access and the very fact of the modality of different experiences and different perceptions. And so with some study about the actual technical side behind that, I was able to pick that up relatively quickly. Which is not to say I didn&#8217;t make absolutely horrible mistakes in 2004 and five.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:29] Nathan Wrigley: It&#8217;s almost, it&#8217;s something that came from your, your background,. Your family enabled you to have some sort of prior wisdom. Most of the rest of us, I would imagine are coming at it pretty cold, and if we were to go back, I don&#8217;t know, 5, 6, 7, 8 years, I feel like nobody was really talking about this. I could be wrong. Obviously you were interested in it, but as a proportion of the people that were designing websites, I feel that accessibility was not on everybody&#8217;s radar. I would imagine that many, many of the websites out there were not accessible in any way, shape or form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s become a real talking point in the last few years and people are making much more of an effort. Obviously you&#8217;ve got your conversation, your presentation at the event in the next couple of days. I&#8217;m just wondering if you could outline for those people who, maybe they&#8217;re new to WordPress, maybe they&#8217;re new to web design and they hear the word accessibility and they just think, well, I don&#8217;t know what that means. Just, in the broadest possible brush strokes. Just let us know what the 10,000 foot high version of accessibility on the web is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:31] Joe Dolson: So yeah, the 10,000 foot view. Accessibility, web accessibility, and the access to information for people with disabilities is about making sure that the content you&#8217;ve put on your website is interpretable to the most, the widest variety of senses. So for people who are visually impaired, that means making sure everything can be understood by what&#8217;s called a screen reader. That will look at the text content of your site, look at the code of your site and interpret that in voice production.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For people with hearing impairments, that&#8217;s about having captions for your video. It&#8217;s about having transcriptions of your audio files. So it&#8217;s really about recognizing that people have different ways of perceiving the world, whether that&#8217;s because of dyslexia, and they have difficulty with the way text is structured. Or it&#8217;s visually impaired, so that they literally cannot see your images and have no idea what that is. Your responsibility in sharing that information is making sure it&#8217;s available to multiple senses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:40] Nathan Wrigley: Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your talk is called finding and fixing the six most common WCAG, W C A G, two failures. First of all, what&#8217;s WCAG 2? And then if you wouldn&#8217;t mind elucidating what are those six most common failures? Maybe we just go through them one at a time, and if we, if we stray off into a conversation about each one of them, that&#8217;d be good, and if not, we&#8217;ll carry on from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:02] Joe Dolson: Sounds great. So the web content accessibility guidelines is a document coming out of the W3C, the worldwide web consortium, and it&#8217;s kind of the international standard for what is considered to be accessibility. Version two is the version that was published in, I wanna say 2008. So it&#8217;s not new. But it&#8217;s been then updated periodically since then. The current version is 2.1. 2.2 is currently a candidate. It is likely to become a recommendation sometime at the beginning of 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that just keeps incrementing different ways of looking at things and what is considered to be a standard internationally for what makes content accessible. It&#8217;s a very useful document. It is enshrined in law in a number of contexts. The US government&#8217;s section 5 0 8 is based on WCAG 2. A lot of international laws such as what the EU uses for their guidelines are based on WCAG 2. So being aware of these guidelines is pretty key.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:07] Nathan Wrigley: Just before we go into the six areas that your presentation is about. When you say that the things are enshrined in law, and you mentioned the US and the EU in particular, I guess there&#8217;s going to be a whole swathe of different responsibilities and things that you are compelled to do. You are in the US, so just give us an idea, just paint the picture in the US specifically, and we&#8217;ll just ignore the rest of the world for now, about what the absolute requirements are. So, in other words, if you don&#8217;t satisfy this, you are in breach of the law. So are you able to speak to that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:40] Joe Dolson: I can definitely speak to that. And it&#8217;s definitely good that we&#8217;re narrowing that just to the US, because otherwise this would go on for hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:47] Nathan Wrigley: One country time. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:49] Joe Dolson: So in the US, what we&#8217;ve got is section 5 0 8, which is part of the federal regulations governing the acquisition of software for government institutions. And that only applies when you&#8217;re getting funding from the federal government. So you&#8217;re only in violation of that if, for example, you&#8217;re a university and your website is funded by federal grants. And that is, 100% it&#8217;s based on WCAG 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few tweaks that are not exactly identical, but basically if you&#8217;re violating WCAG 2 at what&#8217;s called level AA, there are three levels of severity within WCAG. There&#8217;s level A, AA and triple A. Triple A is usually very specific types of errors that apply to relatively small populations and mostly need to be handled if you&#8217;re specifically serving that population. The guidelines, the laws are around AA, which is gonna be very broad, but it&#8217;s still, there&#8217;s got a fair amount of meat to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other law is the ADA, which is a 1991 law, and this may shock you, but at the time it was written, they did not directly address websites. And that does not mean that website accessibility isn&#8217;t covered by the ADA, and case law has repeatedly demonstrated through precedent, that yes, the ADA does require websites that are publicly accessible and commercial need to be accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is lacking in the US is any regulations that stipulate what that means, and that is a case where WCAG has not been brought into the legal bounds on these websites. And that is why you hear so much about so many lawsuits against companies for web accessibility. It&#8217;s because we don&#8217;t have regulations that allow anybody to easily look at their website and determine whether or not they&#8217;ve met those requirements. Really. the ADA stipulates your website needs to be accessible, it needs to provide this equal access. Figure out what that means.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:50] Nathan Wrigley: You just mentioned lawyers and that&#8217;s kind of an interesting place to go just for a moment. It feels like there&#8217;s two premises here. We could have the carrot approach, or we could have the stick approach and the stick approach, by that, I mean is the threat of somebody contacts a lawyer and threatens to sue you because your website is not up to scratch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, there&#8217;s the, uh, carrot approach, which is the kind of thing that I&#8217;m imagining you are doing. You&#8217;re involved in educating the community and, and making this stuff happen with a little bit of education. Do we need to fear the lawyers, the stick approach? Is that an increasing thing that&#8217;s happening? I mean, you see it in all other walks of life. People are sued for things that they haven&#8217;t done because people think they might be able to make a little bit of money out of it. Is that kind of on the horizon? Are people doing that? Do we need to be worried about the legal aspect?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:36] Joe Dolson: Yes, 100%. As recently as six or seven years ago, I would&#8217;ve said no, you don&#8217;t really seriously to worry about that unless you&#8217;re an international scale company. And that&#8217;s just not true anymore. And that&#8217;s directly because we don&#8217;t have those regulations. They&#8217;ve been slated to be added on many, many occasions, and keep getting canceled. They are currently on the docket to be created again, hopefully in 2023. But until that happens, we don&#8217;t really have anything that gives us a goal. And one of the things that regulations could come with is a schedule. A schedule of enforcement. That&#8217;s what certainly a lot of other places have done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The province of Ontario created a document, the AODA, which is a set of laws within Ontario for what is needed to accessible, and that came with a schedule of enforcement. Instead we have a free for all. Anything could happen. And there are thousands of accessibility lawsuits every year. And a lot of them are just accident chasers effectively. They&#8217;re not people with a very serious concern. They&#8217;re just looking for a quick payoff. And that is a horrible, horrible scenario to be in because you might receive one of these demand letters, and there&#8217;s a very good chance you are in fact in violation of it, and it is legitimate, even though they probably wouldn&#8217;t pursue it in court, but you can&#8217;t count on that. So it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a very unpleasant situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:09] Nathan Wrigley: That, is curious. But also, conversations like this and podcast episodes like this, at least we&#8217;re alerting people to the fact that this is something to be taken seriously. I wonder at what level, like you mentioned six or seven years ago, if you are a, a major corporation, you probably needed to worry about this. And then as though six or seven years have passed, presumably that barrier has gone lower and lower and lower. But at some point it doesn&#8217;t matter who you are, you are going to be liable unless you take this sort of stuff seriously. Sorry, you were gonna say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:35] Joe Dolson: Right, right, right. I was say that there usually is a point when you get down into non-commercial websites, when things do get a lot fuzzier as to whether or not you&#8217;re likely to be liable, but that&#8217;s really a question that the law should be settling and the regulations should be settling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we should probably do is actually get to these six error types. All right. Let&#8217;s do it. So the number one is low contrast text, and that literally means where you have gray text on a slightly darker gray background, and it&#8217;s just hard to read. And there are a lot of very very specific calculations that determine in WCAG what is considered to be low contrast or not. It&#8217;s an extremely easy thing to test for, and it&#8217;s just a matter of trying to meet those guidelines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody is trying to claim that these color perception tests are perfect. It&#8217;s a number. It&#8217;s intended to be there so that you have to meet this basic minimum. An important thing to remember about contrast is that this is not a scenario where higher contrast is automatically better. If you&#8217;ve met the guideline, you&#8217;re in perfectly good shape. You do not need to then go, oh, but I should probably just go black on white. That&#8217;s not necessarily better. There&#8217;s a whole population of people who will actually find that to be a completely separate struggle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After contrast, it&#8217;s all about, images and that&#8217;s images that are either missing alternative text, have generic alternative text, like just image or file or something useless, or are repetitive. And that&#8217;s going to be cases where maybe you&#8217;ve got a linked image next to a link where the text of that alt text is exactly the same as the text of the link, it&#8217;s just duplicate. It&#8217;s not helping anybody. These are also really easy to find because you can easily identify that your images have this really common recurring pattern. In a lot of cases in the world of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, you might have a block pattern that&#8217;s producing an image with a heading and some text. And if that block pattern is just presetting an alternative text to something that&#8217;s not good, that&#8217;s where you might have a problem, it just needs to be dealt with and fixed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:50] Nathan Wrigley: Can I just interrupt there a moment, because a default install of WordPress will give you more than alternative text. You&#8217;ve got descriptions and captions and so on. You only mentioned alternative text. Is that the case? It&#8217;s just that one field that we need to be mindful of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;re describing what is in the image. So, for example, if there&#8217;s a red car with a, I don&#8217;t know, a dog in the backseat or something you would write, this is an image of a red car with a dog in the backseat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:15] Joe Dolson: That&#8217;s a great question. I&#8217;m gonna answer two parts of that. First of all, you don&#8217;t describe the image. You describe the purpose of the image, which may or may not be a description of the image. It really depends on the context. For example, if that image is a link to a post, then what that image is actually conveying to the user is, what is this link for? Which is not necessarily going to be what is the image of. Which is also a question for, is this the right image for this? If that alt text doesn&#8217;t make any sense with that image, then maybe this isn&#8217;t the right image. But ultimately what you&#8217;re actually describing is the purpose of the image. It might be that it&#8217;s an image of a dog in the backseat of a red car.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing I wanna mention about that is you would not say, image of. Because that is already going to be predicted and produced by the screen reader. They know it&#8217;s an image. You got that covered. And that is an extremely common problem actually, is people stating that it is an image? Totally unnecessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:15] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. So we went through number one and number two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:18] Joe Dolson: Well, there was another part of that, which is the WordPress fields. So the WordPress media library has four fields that can be filled in. Title, alternative text, caption and description. Those four things all serve completely different purposes. The title is really only for administrative use. In very old versions of WordPress, it was used to add a title attribute, but that has not been the case for many years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The alternative text is the thing that basically represents the image. It&#8217;s the alternative to the image. When that image is not available, whether it&#8217;s because somebody can&#8217;t perceive it or because it doesn&#8217;t load. That&#8217;s the thing that should take the place of that image. And that&#8217;s the generic version of it because the things stored in the media library is just one alternative text. So usually that is going to be a description of the image. In actual use, you may or may not want to use that text depending on the context. Again, with that linked image, it&#8217;s not necessarily a description of it. It might be a description of the target.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the caption, the caption is a thing that should be universally available. So both people who are sighted and people who are visually impaired will be able to see that. So really it&#8217;s something that should be complimentary to the image. It gives additional context, but doesn&#8217;t necessarily explicitly describe it. An example there would be, it might be used to say who is in the image. For example, you know, the description is a man with glasses and a beard, stroking a cat. And then the caption actually says, this is a picture of our founder, Joe Dolson and his cat Bubbles. I don&#8217;t have a cat named bubbles. just to be clear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:00] Nathan Wrigley: There was more in that than I, I imagined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:02] Joe Dolson: The description field is actually not used by default unless your theme has decided that there&#8217;s some context in which that&#8217;s used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:09] Nathan Wrigley: So, okay, we&#8217;ve done one and two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:10] Joe Dolson: Moving on to number three. That&#8217;s form fields without labels. And that is an incredibly big deal. I mean, if you have a contact form or a search form or a sales form, any kind of query, and those form fields don&#8217;t have labels, then basically a user with a screen reader, they don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re trying to do. They have no idea what this is. Frequently, you have form fields that have text nearby that is visually a label, it looks like it has a label. But if there&#8217;s no explicit association between that information, because a label is a specific HTML field and it&#8217;s connected to an input using a for attribute and an ID, attribute. And that makes it really straightforward, really explicit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that tells somebody what this field is for. And those being missing are just, that&#8217;s just wrong. It should not be missing. Next one after that, and I&#8217;m just gonna collapse the next two into one because they&#8217;re effectively the same problem. Empty links and empty buttons. That is literally a link that does not have any text contained inside it, or a button that doesn&#8217;t have any text. As often as not that&#8217;s because they&#8217;re either an image that doesn&#8217;t have an alt attribute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s nothing meaningful there. It&#8217;s like a font icon or an SVG image that is supposed to represent your hamburger menu, or it&#8217;s a close icon, or it&#8217;s a help icon or any of those many possibilities, but doesn&#8217;t have any kind of accessible name. It doesn&#8217;t have any attributes that give that a text context. So the screen reader knows what this is supposed to do. Those are also extremely common.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last of the six, and this is quite rare to be a problem on a WordPress site because WordPress pretty much takes care of this, is a missing document language. Every HTML element should have a lang attribute that declares what language the document is in. English, German, French, Spanish, whatever. And the purpose of that for a screen reader is to tell them how to pronounce it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not having that means it will be pronounced according to whatever that person&#8217;s local settings are. So if they&#8217;re a French browser on an English site, the English is gonna have a very strong accent. And in fact, it&#8217;s not really an accent because it&#8217;s following a completely different set of pronunciation rules and that&#8217;s going to make it incomprehensible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So making sure that that attribute is present is really important. I haven&#8217;t seen that as a problem on a WordPress site with a theme that&#8217;s reasonably recent for a long time. There were definitely a lot of older themes where, big problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:49] Nathan Wrigley: I&#8217;m guessing that the six things that you brought to the table could easily be 15, 20 things, but six was the number that was chosen there. I guess the problem is you could have gone on all day and we could have talked for hours about all the other things, but these are the things that have risen to the surface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So anybody who&#8217;s not encountered this is now going to be presented with additional things to do. Work to be undertaken. Things to be learned and so on and so forth. I&#8217;m just wondering if there&#8217;s any, any useful things, tools for want of a better word that you have found over the years that have enabled you to short circuit things, make things as easy as possible. So it might be a browser extension, or I don&#8217;t know, some app that you can install on your computer or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:32] Joe Dolson: Yes, there are an incredible number of these types of tools, and they all have slightly different ways of working, slightly different sets of tests. But these particular six items, all of the automated tests are going to find these and help you solve them. They&#8217;ll give you guidance about what you have and what you need to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think some of the ones I use the most are going to be, there&#8217;s an automated tester from tenon.io, and that&#8217;s an application that you can run remotely. It&#8217;s got an API, you can run it just automatically. And it&#8217;ll just scan a page and give you a list of everything it&#8217;s found on it..</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another one is wave.webaim.org. That&#8217;s from the same group of people who produced this report that found these errors. And that&#8217;s available as a toolbar for, I think it&#8217;s Chrome. Firefox or Edge, so pretty broadly available. It&#8217;s also testing one page at a time, but they do have a tool through a company called Pope Tech, that can give you generated reports of larger sets of pages. So you can get a much larger body of data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are browser extensions from an organization called Deque called Axe. Those also do a wide variety of automated tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that&#8217;s important in development with accessibility is that it&#8217;s always something that needs to be based on the rendered site. There&#8217;s a reason they&#8217;re called the web content accessibility guidelines. It&#8217;s because it&#8217;s all about the user experience and what they&#8217;re actually getting. So there aren&#8217;t a lot of tools for doing like pre-production linting as part of your development. You know, you can do some of that in an end to end test, but it&#8217;s going to be very limited because it&#8217;s, there&#8217;s so many assumptions you have to make.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the real world is where people have put in content that, the content is what&#8217;s really causing problems. Anything with these images, almost all of that is problems coming from content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:28] Nathan Wrigley: So it strikes me from what you&#8217;ve just said, that there might be a better place to put this work. This work that needs to be done in the workflow of a typical website. And from what you&#8217;ve just said, it sounds like it would be better done toward, the end of the development cycle?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:43] Joe Dolson: Different parts of it fall in different locations. So low contrast text, for example, is frequently a design issue. So that as often as not should go at the very, very beginning. That&#8217;s when you&#8217;re deciding what kind of color palette you&#8217;re going to use and what your base design looks like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The images, it&#8217;s a mix, because it depends on whether you&#8217;re using a plugin that generates a body of images, or you&#8217;re using images embedded into content. In the latter case, it&#8217;s a content production issue. So it&#8217;s something that you should be checking on the fly and should be done on a constantly recurring basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the application environment, for, you know, a plugin that&#8217;s producing these lists. That needs to be fixed in the development side, on that plugin of whatever it&#8217;s doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Form fields are another one where most of that needs to come from the plugin that&#8217;s generating your form. Gravity Forms has done a huge amount of work on improving the accessibility of their product. They&#8217;ve got more to do. It&#8217;s always, these things are a constant battle of, oh, we screwed this up now we&#8217;ve gotta fix it. Oh, we fix this, but now we screwed that up. But Gravity Forms has done a really great job, and one of the advantages to that is that they don&#8217;t give you a lot of room to screw it up. Just make sure that legacy markup is not turned on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:58] Nathan Wrigley: There&#8217;s a whole other conversation I think to be had there as well, but&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:01] Joe Dolson: There&#8217;s a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:03] Nathan Wrigley: In terms of a typical agency, let&#8217;s say who&#8217;s done none of this work before. They&#8217;ve got a legacy of websites. Let&#8217;s say, I don&#8217;t know, 50 websites, which they&#8217;re maintaining and they&#8217;ve built. So suddenly we are presenting the agency with work that they need to go back, and if you like retro fit the websites that they&#8217;ve already built and bring them up to standard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then of course, there&#8217;s gonna be the new work which comes through the door and that&#8217;s gonna be a little bit more straightforward. This brings to mind the question, how much do we need to be doing of this now? How imperative is it for us to go back to our clients and say, look, we need to begin this work yesterday?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or is it more a case going back to the clients and saying, maybe it&#8217;s time to begin again. And I know that&#8217;s not gonna be a comfortable conversation to have. Essentially what I&#8217;m trying to say, is it easy to retrofit or is it sometimes easy just to begin again almost?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:55] Joe Dolson: It is absolutely frequently easier to begin again. But it&#8217;s it is very much a case by case scenario. One of the things about the WordPress environment and this ecosystem, is that there&#8217;s a huge number of themes and plugins that you&#8217;re building your sites based on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If those themes and plugins are issuing updates and they&#8217;re fixing problems, then a lot of the problems that are coming out of those tools can be fixed for you. And I mean that&#8217;s why I think the people who should be looking at this first and foremost are the tool creators. WordPress Core, plugin authors, theme authors, because that is going to solve the biggest, most global problems. And when I say global, I mean, these are things that are infecting, that are affecting entire sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I said, infecting. It&#8217;s kind of an interesting perspective, I like that in some ways, I don&#8217;t know. They&#8217;re infected with inaccessibility. But anyway, if these plugins can fix something then they can have an impact on thousands, millions of sites. I mean this is one of the reasons I contributed to WordPress at all is if I can make one little change, it can potentially impact millions of sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:06] Nathan Wrigley: Just the answer to this may simply be a no, and it goes nowhere else. But is there any sort of an accreditation system that things like plugins can get certified against. So that, for example, you mentioned Gravity Forms as a good example of a company that have done some work in that area. So that you could visit their website, see the accreditation stamp somewhere and say, okay, I&#8217;m assured that at least some of the work has been done. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s even a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:31] Joe Dolson: There&#8217;s nothing that I&#8217;m aware of really for plugins. There&#8217;s an organization. It&#8217;s the IAAP, the international association of accessibility professionals. Uh, and they certify people as specialists. In the theme world the WordPress theme repository does have the accessibility ready tag that does require some manual testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugins are a really difficult case because it&#8217;s hard to set a specific set of tests and guidelines that they have to meet because they do so many different things. For some plugins, there are no settings, there&#8217;s no user interface, it just does some automation. And you&#8217;re like, well, is that accessible? It literally has no interface. How do we judge that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:14] Nathan Wrigley: Okay, so, we talked about retrofitting. We talked about beginning and potentially that the beginning is the easiest way to go forward. That therefore raises the question of how much of this do you need to be mindful of before you can say, that site is ready to ship. And bluntly let&#8217;s say, is it okay to have a site where 10% of the tick list that you want to achieve has been completed?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is that okay to launch, or do we need to be higher into the fifties, or indeed the nineties, or the 100%? In other words, is it better to do something and launch it, rather than wait until it&#8217;s perfect? We know how this works. If we build websites, we&#8217;ve had this problem time and again. You know, things creep in that we need to do, and we never end up launching the product because we&#8217;re constantly, constantly making it perfect. So just some guidance on where we need to be there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:05] Joe Dolson: So it&#8217;s a slightly different answer depending on whether we&#8217;re building a new product or making changes and retrofitting something old. When you&#8217;re retrofitting, in my opinion, it&#8217;s just, the goal is make it better every day. If you can ship an update that fixes one problem, then fix that one problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s better. It doesn&#8217;t have to go from zero to a hundred in an instant. There&#8217;s no reason to wait. To shift an improvement. When it&#8217;s a new product I would say 10% is awfully low, because we all know how priorities work And as soon as that product gets in front of users. Now you&#8217;ve got user demands. You&#8217;ve got clients who just are like, oh, I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t know that I want to pay anything more right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that additional percentage may just never happen. So going over 10% is definitely worthwhile. But you should always recognize that there is no a hundred percent. Like you&#8217;re not going to achieve a hundred percent accessibility. The range of human experience and human perception is far too great. All you can reach for is try and think of everything you can, and everything that seems reachable and that you understand and recognize that you&#8217;re going to make mistakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:20] Nathan Wrigley: You were mentioning earlier about the lawyering and how that has become a thing. And I&#8217;m wondering who is the person who&#8217;s responsible. So in other words, if you are the web designer and you&#8217;ve taken on that work and you&#8217;ve handed over to your client, but then they&#8217;ve taken over for example, and they&#8217;re maintaining and updating from this moment forward. Is there any guidance around that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, can you insulate yourself from the problems which may occur? And again, there&#8217;s a myriad set of different ways that we could build and hand over and all of those kind of things, but, I&#8217;m sure a lot of people listening to this will be thinking, okay, how can I protect myself, having done some of it, but not all of it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:58] Joe Dolson: This is definitely one of the areas where that gap in regulation is a real problem. In terms of responsibility that ultimately falls on the business owner, the website owner, or the product owner. But of course, the terms of your contract will vary and your specific liability to the outcome of your product might vary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even in the most solidly constructed contract where you protect yourself, that doesn&#8217;t mean you couldn&#8217;t be sued for negligence. You know these things all revolve around. If a company ends up having to pay damages of $7 million because of an inaccessible website, it&#8217;s very reasonable to think they&#8217;re gonna go back to the people who they hired to work on that website and be like, we are not happy. I think that&#8217;s an extremely justified position to be in. So I think everybody needs to take a piece of this responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know for a fact that, in the Ontario law, the AODA, they do explicitly specify that everything on the website has to be accessible, including third party products that you are using. So a common problem in a lot of websites that I&#8217;ve audited, you know, it&#8217;s a nonprofit, they&#8217;ve got a great accessible website, but they&#8217;re using this client relationships, module, a CRM to take their donations, and it&#8217;s a mess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;re like, okay, this is an absolutely key part of keeping your organization operating, is getting these donations working and that&#8217;s not accessible. So you really do have a problem there. And that&#8217;s a third party application. You don&#8217;t have any direct control over it. You can&#8217;t directly fix it, and I think that&#8217;s a marketplace problem. Where all of these elements within the overall picture have to be thinking about what their responsibility is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:50] Nathan Wrigley: You&#8217;re obviously very keen on this. And I&#8217;m just wondering if this is becoming an industry. In other words, a few years ago, we didn&#8217;t have SEO experts. Well, quite a long time ago now, but let&#8217;s say 20 years ago, there was no such thing as an SEO expert. It just, wasn&#8217;t a thing. Now there is. There&#8217;s people who you would hire in because you want to take over the SEO and give it to somebody else. And that&#8217;s now their responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there a growing collection of people like yourself, who you can hire in to examine and look, so you&#8217;re not relying on the tools, the automated tools. You&#8217;re really getting a, a human being in to do the real work, and yeah, is there a career there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:30] Joe Dolson: Oh, absolutely. It is actually a huge growing market. I think the growth of the accessibility consulting and testing market is pretty high. I don&#8217;t know what it is right now off the top of my head, but it&#8217;s a growth market with no question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as somebody who&#8217;s been in accessibility for almost 20 years, there&#8217;s always been an industrial market for accessibility. 20 years ago, it was almost exclusively in government, universities, higher ed, that sort of area. And it has been growing very rapidly. There are a lot of large companies now that they exclusively provide accessibility consulting. There&#8217;s actually been a lot of consolidation and acquisition within the accessibility space. So there&#8217;s no question that this is absolutely a major career. It&#8217;s a market where if you engage in some training and accessibility, there are jobs to be had. They are all hiring, and this is because it has grown enormously in the last four or five years,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:31] Nathan Wrigley: Which brings me to nearly my last question, and that is, imagine that we&#8217;re working for a large agency and we are employed by a boss who, how to put this, does not care about the last half an hour&#8217;s conversation that we&#8217;ve had. And just simply wants to ship things as quickly as possible, and obviously what you are proposing is not as quickly as possible. There&#8217;s other work that needs to be done on top of that. So we could hire out, we could find somebody such as yourself, who&#8217;s able to guide us with our, your expertise. But, what do we say to those bosses? How do we persuade them that, not only does this matter, but it&#8217;s essential?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:08] Joe Dolson: So I think, you know, some people are unpersuadable. There are always going to be a group of people for whom this is simply not, not something they are going to choose to care about. And those people will ultimately only be persuaded by legal action. And so when their company gets sued, they will have no choice but to deal with that. But operating on the assumption that we&#8217;re working with somebody who at least is willing to listen to reason and to, justifications about why this needs to be done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of arguments in favor of it, in terms of the fact that it makes websites easier to use. It makes processes easier for customers. So there&#8217;s a, there&#8217;s an acquisition aspect. There&#8217;s a sales benefit. Just making things easier to use, making things possible to use by more people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an estimate of around 15% of the world population has some form of disability that could impact their experience on the web. And a lot of that is in cognitive impairments, where they might have problems with distraction, or lack of focus, short term memory loss, and all of those people are going to benefit enormously from the same kinds of principles that go into web accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so on a, on a marketing argument, the very fact that by implementing accessibility, you can increase your potential market by 15% is something that should be relevant. I think there is a perception sometimes that people with disabilities aren&#8217;t a market with money to spend. That&#8217;s a bias that&#8217;s coming through things like, the social security programs for supporting people with disabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the fact is, in this era the percentage of people with disabilities who are able to be gainfully employed is rapidly increasing because the digital marketplace takes away a lot of the barriers. You don&#8217;t have to necessarily travel to your job, which might be very difficult if you are visually impaired. Or if you have problems with distraction in an environment, or you just need to be able to get away from over stimulation. So</p>\n\n\n\n<p>that market is increasing. I think, I think it&#8217;s the US number right around now. I happen to do a presentation on Thursday morning about accessible advertising. So a lot of these numbers are things that I&#8217;m remembering from my presentation two days ago, that the estimated buying power of the US disability, people with disabilities, is around 350 billion. But an awfully high number of products cannot be purchased by those people, because they&#8217;re not accessible. There&#8217;s an awful lot of people with disabilities where I buy from this company. Why? Because it&#8217;s the only one I can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:58] Nathan Wrigley: That is absolutely fascinating. And it really speaks to the question that I asked. If you have a boss who doesn&#8217;t care, potentially this is the quickest route to somebody caring. There is a market, it&#8217;s a growing market. You can be more profitable by making these tweaks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Final question if that&#8217;s okay? We&#8217;ve talked about a lot. There&#8217;s probably gonna be a lot of confusion about where do I go, how do I find out more about these things? And you&#8217;ve sent me, we had a little shared show notes, and you&#8217;ve sent me a bunch of links. It&#8217;s gonna be difficult for us to spell them all out. I will put every link in the show notes and hopefully get them done correctly. Do you just wanna say something about the best places, the most reliable, the quickest wins, if you like that you have come across where people could? I don&#8217;t know, two or three or four of them that you&#8217;re happy to share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:41] Joe Dolson: So yeah, I mean the list of people I&#8217;ve mentioned, they all have unique perspectives and great information. I always recommend when you&#8217;re trying to get the current best practices on how things really work and what is, what support is available for a particular interaction interface. I like to go to Adrian Roselli. He&#8217;s very, very thorough researcher on accessibility issues. And one of the best things about what he publishes is that he routinely updates things. So his website does not have stale content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I shouldn&#8217;t say that absolutely. I haven&#8217;t read everything on his site. It might have stale content, but I&#8217;m not aware of it. So that&#8217;s a great place because you can trust that it&#8217;s going to be current and maintained and is very thorough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also like Haydon Pickering and Scott O&#8217;Hara. That might be O&#8217;Hara. I honestly don&#8217;t know. They both do a lot of nitty gritty experimental of, this is how you use these various accessible interactions. They&#8217;re great resources. And then there&#8217;s a general website, it&#8217;s the A11Y project, the accessibility project. And that publishes articles by a lot of very experienced accessibility practitioners who&#8217;ve been around for a long time, who are new to the industry, but writing really solid information about how things work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then of course there&#8217;s the actual WCAG documentation. There&#8217;s a lot of information from the web accessibility initiative, the WAI working group, and they have an enormous amount of information about just general, what it means to be accessible and what an accessible interface looks like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:25] Nathan Wrigley: Overlays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:26] Joe Dolson: Ha, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:27] Nathan Wrigley: Overlays have cropped up. Essentially what we&#8217;re dealing with here is a, click a button, I will solve all of your website accessibility needs. That sounds too good to be true. It sounds too simple to be able to install something, let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s a plugin or a piece of JavaScript or whatever it may be, and to say to yourself, I&#8217;m done. I am compliant. I&#8217;ve done all of the things by installing some small bit of code. Tell me your thoughts about this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:54] Joe Dolson: Well, you know, if things seem too good to be true, it might be because they&#8217;re false. And that is absolutely the case with overlays. If an overlay is claiming, I&#8217;m going to solve your problems, you don&#8217;t need to think about anything else, you are now compliant, that&#8217;s because they&#8217;re lying to you. Flat out lying to you. Because what overlays are is they&#8217;re kind of a side effect of the accident chasing, legal thing. They&#8217;re a reaction of, oh, we have all this AI. We can solve things. We can find all these problems. It&#8217;s amazing. This is fabulous. But they can&#8217;t, because the problems are vastly more complex than they actually think they are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So many things simply, you can&#8217;t even test to identify the problem, let alone fix it. So overlays are basically just a disaster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:44] Nathan Wrigley: Is there any scenario in which they represent a decent bridge? In other words if, if you just click that button, get that overlay on there, and then begin the good work that you&#8217;ve described during the podcast, all the other things that you can do. Is there any scenario where that could be recommended? Knowing that it was the temporary kludge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:02] Joe Dolson: Mostly, no. Now I will say that&#8217;s a no in terms of any of the really major overlay vendors, because for the most part, they are actually going to make your website worse. There are certain of those vendors who will absolutely, definitely make it worse. And there are browser extensions that have been marketed directly to the disability community for the sole reason of disabling these overlays because of the problems they cause for people with disabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some extremely narrow categories where an overlay can bridge that, and a lot of the major accessibility corporations as part of their work, they will build an overlay, a custom overlay, which specifically deals with specific problems on your website. And that&#8217;s going to be in cases where the process to actually get the backend code updated is too burdensome, and they need something fast. But it&#8217;s only gonna solve a tiny fraction of those problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That should be something that&#8217;s custom, that&#8217;s targeted. I have a plugin, WP Accessibility. It includes some overlay aspects within it, but they are very targeted because they are targeted at specific things that are known to happen with WordPress or with WordPress themes, and they have known answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even then, I wouldn&#8217;t say that&#8217;s something that guaranteed to fix everything. It could still cause problems. And you shouldn&#8217;t keep it installed and operating in that manner any longer than you absolutely have to, because fundamentally what you need to do is get the fix in place But these big commercial overlays are just horrendous. They make things worse, period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:47:44] Nathan Wrigley: There was one further question. Sorry, I was sneaking this one in right at the end. I also asked you to recommend a community that you thought was worth hanging out in, because that&#8217;s often a way to just sort of speed up the process. You find some friends in there and they help you and they point you in the right direction. So, you&#8217;ve mentioned one here. Do you just wanna tell us about that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:01] Joe Dolson: So there&#8217;s a Slack community for web accessibility professionals. It&#8217;s web-a11y.slack.com, and there&#8217;s about 10,000 members of that Slack organization. And it&#8217;s a great place to ask questions, look for advice, read what other people have done, search for past conversations on various topics. It&#8217;s a pretty large Slack. It&#8217;s very active. It&#8217;s kind of the place where the community mostly hangs out I would say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:32] Nathan Wrigley: And should anybody wish to find you Joe, off the back of this. If you&#8217;re willing to share, what are the best places to get in touch with you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:39] Joe Dolson: I&#8217;d say the best places for me, you can find me on Twitter @joedolson, J O E D O L S O N. You can find me in the WordPress Slack, also Joe Dolson. Pretty much anywhere I am, you&#8217;ll find me as Joe Dolson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:54] Nathan Wrigley: Thank you very much for joining us on the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:56] Joe Dolson: Thank you. Thanks for having me.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://www.joedolson.com/\">Joe Dolson</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe is a WordPress plugin developer, a core committer, and a web accessibility consultant. He’s part of the Make WordPress Accessible team, the team dedicated to improving accessibility in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His recent presentation at WordCamp US entitled ‘<a href=\"https://www.joedolson.com/\">Finding and Fixing the Six Most Common WCAG 2 Failures</a>’, highlights some of the key areas where websites are not as accessible as they should be. The areas we discuss are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>low contrast text</li>\n\n\n\n<li>missing alternative text</li>\n\n\n\n<li>empty links</li>\n\n\n\n<li>missing form labels</li>\n\n\n\n<li>empty buttons</li>\n\n\n\n<li>missing document language</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe explains what each of these problems are, both in terms of how they can be fixed, as well as what people with accessibility requirements might experience when they visit your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about how you can equip yourself with the tools that you need to diagnose these issues, and online resources you can use to discover more about website accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s Joe’s opinion that you’re better off making a start right now, carrying out incremental changes rather than attempting to solve every single problem that your website might have. Begin the journey and take it one problem at a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also chat about the fact that there’s an ever growing legal compulsion to make websites follow accessibility guidelines. Lawsuits are going through the courts with greater regularity, so now might be the time to look into this topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, Joe cautions against the use of tools which purport to solve your accessibility issues with minimal effort. A variety of pop-up solutions have emerged onto the market which claim that they can make your site compliant with almost no effort. Joe is adamant that these promises are almost always false and that there’s real work to be done on each website as they’re all unique and have unique problems to solve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, when we record the podcast, there’s not a lot of background noise, but that’s not always the case. Over the coming weeks, I’ll be bringing you recordings from a recent trip to WordCamp US 2022, and you might notice that the recordings have a little echo or other strange audio artefacts. Whilst the podcasts are more than listenable, I hope you understand that the vagaries of the real world were at play.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.joedolson.com/\">Joe Dolson&#8217;s website</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/joedolson\">Joe Dolson&#8217;s Twitter account</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://adrianroselli.com/\">Adrian Roselli&#8217;s website</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://tink.uk/\">Leonie Watson&#8217;s website</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://heydonworks.com/\">Heydon Pickering&#8217;s website</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.scottohara.me/\">Scott O&#8217;Hara&#8217;s website</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.a11yproject.com/\">The a11y Project</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://web-a11y.slack.com/\">a11y Slack channel</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.deque.com/axe/\">axe accessibility testing tool</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/\">W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://wave.webaim.org/\">WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://tenon.io/\">Tenon.io</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://pope.tech/\">popetech web accessibility testing &amp; reporting</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://webaim.org/\">webAIM website</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://webaim.org/projects/million/\">The WebAIM Million report</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/\">International Association of Accessibility Professionals: IAAP</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.aoda.ca/\">Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)</a></li>\n</ul>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20:\"Matt: Tumblr Updates\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=63462\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"https://ma.tt/2022/09/tumblr-updates/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:888:\"<p><a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/staff/696482214233440256/introducing-community-labels-as-you-know-art-and\">Tumblr launched Community Labels yesterday</a>, which allows consistent tagging of addiction, violent, and adult content, and for people to hide, blur, or show that content.

For example, if a customer is purchasing a new gardener&#8217;s kit, the store may cross-sell gardening gloves as a complementary product. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a new feature is only available to users in the cart, as the idea is to catch the customer at the moment of buying and encourage them to purchase additional products. These are not simply best-selling products but rather are carefully curated to be specific to the item in the cart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cross-sells will show up beneath the cart&#8217;s contents automatically after the store owner identifies them in the product&#8217;s &#8220;linked products&#8221; setting. At the moment, cross-sells are limited to two rows of three products.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Cross-sells show up near the bottom of the cart page before the customer clicks to checkout. This seems like it is squeezed into a crowded place as an afterthought. If you want to make the cross-sells more prominent or change where they appear on the page, it is possible but requires a few extra steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-gutenberg-products-block/\">WooCommerce Blocks</a> is like the Gutenberg plugin for WooCommerce &#8211; it&#8217;s a feature plugin that serves as a place to iterate and test new blocks, and get access to bleeding edge features. With this plugin installed, you can <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/document/using-the-new-block-based-checkout/\">enable the block-based cart</a> by deleting the cart shortcode on the cart page and adding the Cart block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cross-sells now appear in the block-based cart but it is locked in place and cannot be moved up or down on the page. If you want to customize this block further, you must uncheck the boxes that are disabling movement. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>After testing the Cross-Sells block, I found that it is still very limited in how it can be customized. The current experience of this block seems more like a placeholder and it could definitely benefit from more customization options, such as background color options, width adjustment, and the ability to change how the individual products inside the box are displayed. Right now it only has one option to set the number of cross-sells products to display. I was able to move the block to the top of the cart page but could not do much more with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WooCommerce team has requested feedback on the new block and will continue to iterate on it. Version 6.8.0 of WooCommerce Blocks also adds half a dozen fixes and improves compatibility with <a

More specifically, a job is an activity, often regular and often performed in exchange for payment \\\"for a living\\\"Many people have multiple jobs e.g., parent, homemaker, and employee. A person can begin a job by becoming an employee, volunteering, starting a business, or becoming a parent. The duration of a job may range from temporary e.g., hourly odd jobs to a lifetime e.g., judges.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn activity that requires a person\'s mental or physical effort is work as in \\\"a day\'s work\\\". If a person is trained for a certain type of job, they may have a profession. Typically, a job would be a subset of someone\'s career. The two may differ in that one usually retires from their career, versus resignation or termination from a job.\\r\\n\\r\\nTypes of jobs\\r\\nJobs can be categorized, by the hours per week, into full time or part time.

More specifically, a job is an activity, often regular and often performed in exchange for payment \"for a living\"Many people have multiple jobs e.g., parent, homemaker, and employee. A person can begin a job by becoming an employee, volunteering, starting a business, or becoming a parent. The duration of a job may range from temporary e.g., hourly odd jobs to a lifetime e.g., judges.\r\n\r\nAn activity that requires a person\'s mental or physical effort is work as in \"a day\'s work\". If a person is trained for a certain type of job, they may have a profession. Typically, a job would be a subset of someone\'s career. The two may differ in that one usually retires from their career, versus resignation or termination from a job.\r\n\r\nTypes of jobs\r\nJobs can be categorized, by the hours per week, into full time or part time.

The only Denisovan bones and teeth that scientists have, for example, come from a single cave in Siberia.\r\n<h1>Heading 1: How Retail Brands Can Cash in on Content Marketing</h1>\r\nSifting through teaspoons of clay and sand scraped from the floors of caves, German researchers have managed to isolate ancient human DNA — without turning up a single bone.

Lorem Ipsum е индустриален стандарт от около 1500 година, когато неизвестен печатар взема няколко печатарски букви и ги разбърква, за да напечата с тях книга с примерни шрифтове. Този начин не само е оцелял повече от 5 века, но е навлязъл и в публикуването на електронни издания като е запазен почти без промяна. Популяризиран е през 60те години на 20ти век със издаването на Letraset листи, съдържащи Lorem Ipsum пасажи, популярен е и в наши дни във софтуер за печатни издания като Aldus PageMaker, който включва различни версии на Lorem Ipsum.\r\n<h2>Català</h2>\r\nLorem Ipsum és un text de farciment usat per la indústria de la tipografia i la impremta. Lorem Ipsum ha estat el text estàndard de la indústria des de l’any 1500, quan un impressor desconegut va fer servir una galerada de text i la va mesclar per crear un llibre de mostres tipogràfiques. No només ha sobreviscut cinc segles, sinó que ha fet el salt cap a la creació de tipus de lletra electrònics, romanent essencialment sense canvis. Es va popularitzar l’any 1960 amb el llançament de fulls Letraset que contenien passatges de Lorem Ipsum, i més recentment amb programari d’autoedició com Aldus Pagemaker que inclou versions de Lorem Ipsum.\r\n<h2>Hrvatski</h2>\r\nLorem Ipsum je jednostavno probni tekst koji se koristi u tiskarskoj i slovoslagarskoj industriji. Lorem Ipsum postoji kao industrijski standard još od 16-og stoljeća, kada je nepoznati tiskar uzeo tiskarsku galiju slova i posložio ih da bi napravio knjigu s uzorkom tiska. Taj je tekst ne samo preživio pet stoljeća, već se i vinuo u svijet elektronskog slovoslagarstva, ostajući u suštini nepromijenjen. Postao je popularan tijekom 1960-ih s pojavom Letraset listova s odlomcima Lorem Ipsum-a, a u skorije vrijeme sa software-om za stolno izdavaštvo kao što je Aldus PageMaker koji također sadrži varijante Lorem Ipsum-a.\r\n<h2>Česky</h2>\r\nLorem Ipsum je demonstrativní výplňový text používaný v tiskařském a knihařském průmyslu. Lorem Ipsum je považováno za standard v této oblasti už od začátku 16. století, kdy dnes neznámý tiskař vzal kusy textu a na jejich základě vytvořil speciální vzorovou knihu. Jeho odkaz nevydržel pouze pět století, on přežil i nástup elektronické sazby v podstatě beze změny. Nejvíce popularizováno bylo Lorem Ipsum v šedesátých letech 20. století, kdy byly vydávány speciální vzorníky s jeho pasážemi a později pak díky počítačovým DTP programům jako Aldus PageMaker.\r\n<h2>Româna</h2>\r\nLorem Ipsum este pur şi simplu o machetă pentru text a industriei tipografice. Lorem Ipsum a fost macheta standard a industriei încă din secolul al XVI-lea, când un tipograf anonim a luat o planşetă de litere şi le-a amestecat pentru a crea o carte demonstrativă pentru literele respective. Nu doar că a supravieţuit timp de cinci secole, dar şi a facut saltul în tipografia electronică practic neschimbată. A fost popularizată în anii ’60 odată cu ieşirea colilor Letraset care conţineau pasaje Lorem Ipsum, iar mai recent, prin programele de publicare pentru calculator, ca Aldus PageMaker care includeau versiuni de Lorem Ipsum.\r\n<h2>Српски</h2>\r\nLorem Ipsum је једноставно модел текста који се користи у штампарској и словослагачкој индустрији. Lorem ipsum је био стандард за модел текста још од 1500. године, када је непознати штампар узео кутију са словима и сложио их како би направио узорак књиге. Не само што је овај модел опстао пет векова, него је чак почео да се користи и у електронским медијима, непроменивши се. Популаризован је шездесетих година двадесетог века заједно са листовима летерсета који су садржали Lorem Ipsum пасусе, а данас са софтверским пакетом за прелом као што је Aldus PageMaker који је садржао Lorem Ipsum верзије.','Full Width','','publish','closed','closed','','full-width','','','2019-01-24 09:47:03','2019-01-24 09:47:03','',0,'http://rarathemesdemo.com/jobscout-pro/?page_id=140',0,'page','',0),(144,1,'2019-01-24 09:50:14','2019-01-24 09:50:14','','Pages','','publish','closed','closed','','pages-2','','','2019-01-24 09:50:14','2019-01-24 09:50:14','',0,'http://rarathemesdemo.com/jobscout-pro/?p=144',7,'nav_menu_item','',0),(145,1,'2019-01-24 09:50:14','2019-01-24 09:50:14','','Category Page','','publish','closed','closed','','145','','','2019-01-24 09:50:14','2019-01-24 09:50:14','',0,'http://rarathemesdemo.com/jobscout-pro/?p=145',10,'nav_menu_item','',0),(146,1,'2019-01-24 09:50:14','2019-01-24 09:50:14',' ','','','publish','closed','closed','','146','','','2019-01-24 09:50:14','2019-01-24 09:50:14','',0,'http://rarathemesdemo.com/jobscout-pro/?p=146',8,'nav_menu_item','',0),(147,1,'2019-01-24 09:50:33','2019-01-24 09:50:33','','Portfolio','','publish','closed','closed','','portfolio-2','','','2019-01-24 09:50:33','2019-01-24 09:50:33','',0,'http://rarathemesdemo.com/jobscout-pro/?page_id=147',0,'page','',0),(149,1,'2019-01-24 09:52:17','2019-01-24 09:52:17','The style guide provides you with a blueprint of Paperback’s default post and page styles.

The web designer has the ability to understand what is needed to make a website functional and easy to use, but at the same time make it aesthetically appealing to the user.\r\n\r\nCoaching is a form of development in which a person called a coach supports a learner or client in achieving a specific personal or professional goal by providing training and guidance.The learner is sometimes called a coachee. Occasionally, coaching may mean an informal relationship between two people, of whom one has more experience and expertise than the other and offers advice and guidance as the latter learns; but coaching differs from mentoring in focusing on specific tasks or objectives, as opposed to more general goals or overall development.\r\n\r\nThe first use of the term “coach” in connection with an instructor or trainer arose around 1830 in Oxford University slang for a tutor who “carried” a student through an exam.The word “coaching” thus identified a process used to transport people from where they are to where they want to be. The first use of the term in relation to sports came in 1861. Historically the development of coaching has been influenced by many fields of activity, including adult education, the Human Potential Movement, large-group awareness training (LGAT) groups such as “est”, leadership studies, personal development, and psychology.\r\n\r\nProfessional coaching uses a range of communication skills (such as targeted restatements, listening, questioning, clarifying etc.) to help clients shift their perspectives and thereby discover different approaches to achieve their goals.These skills can be used in almost all types of coaching. In this sense, coaching is a form of “meta-profession” that can apply to supporting clients in any human endeavor, ranging from their concerns in health, personal, professional, sport, social, family, political, spiritual dimensions, etc. There may be some overlap between certain types of coaching activities.\r\n\r\nThe concept of ADHD coaching was first introduced in 1994 by psychiatrists Edward M. Hallowell and John J. Ratey in their book Driven to Distraction.ADHD coaching is a specialized type of life coaching that uses specific techniques designed to assist individuals with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. The goal of ADHD coaching is to mitigate the effects of executive function deficit, which is a typical impairment for people with ADHD. Coaches work with clients to help them better manage time, organize, set goals and complete projects. In addition to helping clients understand the impact ADHD has had on their lives, coaches can help clients develop “work-around” strategies to deal with specific challenges, and determine and use individual strengths. Coaches also help clients get a better grasp of what reasonable expectations are for them as individuals, since people with ADHD “brain wiring” often seem to need external mirrors for accurate self-awareness about their potential despite their impairment.','Personal Free HTML Template','','publish','closed','closed','','personal-free-html-template','','','2018-12-26 06:51:24','2018-12-26

They can be categorized as temporary, odd jobs, seasonal, self-employment, consulting, or contract employment.\r\n\r\nJobs can be categorized as paid or unpaid. Examples of unpaid jobs include volunteer, homemaker, mentor, student, and sometimes intern.\r\n\r\nJobs can be categorized by the level of experience required: entry level, intern, and co-op.\r\n\r\nSome jobs require specific training or an academic degree.\r\n\r\nThose without paid full-time employment may be categorized as unemployed or underemployed if they are seeking a full-time paid job.\r\n\r\nMoonlighting is the practice of holding an additional job or jobs, often at night, in addition to one\'s main job, usually to earn extra income. A person who moonlights may have little time left for sleep or leisure activities.\r\n\r\nThe Office for National Statistics in the United Kingdom lists 27,966 different job titles, within a website published 2015.','Administrative Assistant','','expired','closed','closed','','administrative-assistant','','','2022-10-12 03:37:41','2022-10-12 03:37:41','',0,'http://rarathemesdemo.com/jobscout-pro/?post_type=job_listing&#038;p=928',0,'job_listing','',0),(936,1,'2019-02-20 12:43:47','2019-02-20 12:43:47','','Login and Registration','','publish','closed','closed','','login-and-registration','','','2019-02-20 12:43:47','2019-02-20 12:43:47','',0,'http://rarathemesdemo.com/jobscout-pro/?page_id=936',0,'page','',0),(945,1,'2019-02-21 12:03:00','2019-02-21 12:03:00','<label> Your Name (required)\r\n    [text* your-name] </label>\r\n\r\n<label> Your Email (required)\r\n    [email* your-email] </label>\r\n\r\n<label> Phone (required)\r\n    [tel* tel-208] </label>\r\n\r\n<label> What is your current employment status?

Talking to randos is the norm. I’ll never forget the conversation with the aquarium fisherman, forest ranger, and women at the Thai market. It’s refreshing to compare notes on life with people from vastly different backgrounds.\n\nWhen you meet fellow travelers, you’ll find they are also filled with a similar sense of adventure and curiosity about the world. Five days of friendship on the road is like five months of friendship at home. It’s the experiences that bond you together, not the place. A rule I followed that worked well: be the first to initiate conversation. I met some incredible people by simply being the first to talk.\n<blockquote>Make a radical change in your lifestyle and <strong>begin to boldly do things</strong> which you may previously never have thought of doing, or been too hesitant to attempt. But once you become accustomed to such a life you will see its full meaning and its incredible beauty.</blockquote>\n<h4>Travel can be affordable.</h4>\nLong term travel is different than a luxury vacation. The point is to see the world, not stay in a 5-star hotel. During the trip, I stayed on a strict budget. The goal was to spend no more than $33 per day on accommodations. After a year, I was able to spend only $26.15 per day by booking through <a href=\"https://www.google.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HostelWorld</a> and <a href=\"https://www.google.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Airbnb</a>. When I wanted to meet people, I’d stay in a shared room at a hostel. When I wanted to be alone, I’d book a private room with Airbnb.\n\nTake the cost of your rent or mortgage + food per month and divide it by 30. This is how much it costs per day to live at home. You will find that it’s possible to travel the world for roughly the same amount. Or, if you live in an expensive city like San Francisco, far less.\n<h4>English is a universal language.</h4>\nI was surprised how many people spoke English (apparently 1.8 billion people worldwide). Places where English was less prevalent, I made an effort to learn a handful of words and phrases in the local language. Even though it’s passable, I do desire to learn another language fluently. You can only take the conversation so far when all you can say is: <em>“¿Esto contiene gluten?”</em>\n\nIt’s possible to communicate a lot without saying a word. For instance, I left my phone at a restaurant in Chile. I pointed at the table where I was sitting, put my hand to my ear like a phone, then shrugged — 2 minutes later, my phone had been retrieved.\n<h4>Trust your intuition.</h4>\nI learned to trust that tiny voice in my head a bit more. When you are alone in a foreign country and your phone is dead, you are forced to trust your intuition. Is this neighborhood safe to walk around? Is this person someone I should interact with? Am I heading the right direction? Intuition is like a muscle. The more you use it, the stronger it becomes. It’s feels like a sixth sense when you’re able to read between the lines of a situation.\n<blockquote>The world is endless. <strong>The world’s a tiny neighborhood.</strong> My fav people are the ones who can hold two impossible ideas in their heads.</blockquote>','Most famous Beaches in Bali','\n				When you are alone for days or weeks at a time, you eventually become drawn to people.

That is unusual for an engineering student. After a long time I could witness the sunrise. I could feel the sun rays falling on my body. Usual morning is followed by hustle to make it to college on time. This morning was just another morning yet seemed different.\n\nWitnessing calm and quiet atmosphere, clear and fresh air seemed like a miracle to me. I wanted this time to last longer since I was not sure if I would be able to witness it again, knowing my habit of succumbing to schedule. There was this unusual serenity that comforted my mind. It dawned on me, how distant I had been from nature. Standing near the compound’s gate, feeling the moistness that the air carried, <em>I thought about my life so far</em>.\n\nI was good at academics, so decisions of my life had been pretty simple and straight. Being pretty confident I would make it to the best junior college of my town in the first round itself, never made me consider any other option. I loved psychology since childhood, but engineering was the safest option. Being born in a middle class family, thinking of risking your career to make it to medical field was not sane. I grew up hearing <em>‘Only doctor</em>’s children can afford that field’ and finally ended up believing it. No one around me believed in taking risks. Everyone worshiped security. I grew up doing the same.\n<blockquote>This is what has happened to us. We want the things we have been doing forcefully to fail. And then maybe people around us would let us try something else or our dreams. <strong>We are accustomed to live by everyone </strong>else’s <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pullquote-strong\">definition of success. </strong>We punish people for the things they are passionate about, just because we were unable to do the same at some point in our life.</blockquote>\nI feel like these concrete buildings have sucked our desires and our dreams. We are so used to comfort that compromise seems like a taboo. We have lost faith in ourselves. If we can make through it right now, we can do the same in the days to come. You only need a desire to survive and nothing more- not money or cars or designer clothes.\n\n<em>Staying locked up in four walls have restricted our thinking. I feel like our limited thinking echoes through this wall. We are so used to schedules and predictable life that we have successfully suppressed our creative side.</em>\n\nWhen you step out of these four walls on a peaceful morning, you realize how much nature has to offer to you. Its boundless. Your thoughts, worries, deadlines won’t resonate here. Everything will flow away along with the wind. And you will realize every answer you had been looking for, was always known to you.\n\nIt would mean a lot to me if you recommend this article and help me improve. <strong>I would love to know your thoughts!</strong>','Mountain Life & Nature Sounds','\n				Just the other day I happened to wake up early.

Because it is a family business, you inevitably end up wearing many hats and being the czar of many different jobs. I mainly managed projects and worked as a video editor. On production, there were times that I was called on to work as an audio tech and was made to wear headphones on long production days. In those days, having a really good set of headphones that picked up every nuance of sound was essential to making sure the client got what they needed.&nbsp;Many years ago, I worked for my parents who own a video production company.

In those days, having a really good set of headphones that picked up every nuance of sound was essential to making sure the client got what they needed.\n\nNaturally, my first impression of these headphones is based off of the look of them. They have a classic over-the-ear style that is highlighted by <strong>a blue LED light</strong> that indicates the power for the noise canceling. The padding on the ear pieces seems adequate for extended usage periods.\n\nThey are wired headphones, but the 3.5mm stereo mini-plug cable is detachable. Something else I noticed right of the bat was the very nice carrying case that comes with them. It has a hard plastic exterior with a soft cloth interior that helps to protect the surface of the headphones from scratches. I never truly appreciated cases for headphones until I started carrying them from place-to-place.

As I mentioned, they have a classic <em>over-the-ear style</em> and just looking at them, the padding on the ear pieces seem adequate and the peak of the headband seemed to be a bit lacking, but you don’t really know comfort unless you try on the product.

Because it is a family business, you inevitably end up wearing many hats and being the czar of many different jobs. I mainly managed projects and worked as a video editor. On production, there were times that I was called on to work as an audio tech and was made to wear headphones on long production days. In those days, having a really good set of headphones that picked up every nuance of sound was essential to making sure the client got what they needed.

Talking to randos is the norm. I’ll never forget the conversation with the aquarium fisherman, forest ranger, and women at the Thai market. It’s refreshing to compare notes on life with people from vastly different backgrounds.\n\nWhen you meet fellow travelers, you’ll find they are also filled with a similar sense of adventure and curiosity about the world. Five days of friendship on the road is like five months of friendship at home. It’s the experiences that bond you together, not the place. A rule I followed that worked well: be the first to initiate conversation. I met some incredible people by simply being the first to talk.\n\nLong term travel is different than a luxury vacation. The point is to see the world, not stay in a 5-star hotel. During the trip, I stayed on a strict budget. The goal was to spend no more than $33 per day on accommodations. After a year, I was able to spend only $26.15 per day by booking through <a href=\"https://www.google.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HostelWorld</a> and <a href=\"https://www.google.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Airbnb</a>. When I wanted to meet people, I’d stay in a shared room at a hostel. When I wanted to be alone, I’d book a private room with Airbnb.\n\nTake the cost of your rent or mortgage + food per month and divide it by 30. This is how much it costs per day to live at home. You will find that it’s possible to travel the world for roughly the same amount. Or, if you live in an expensive city like San Francisco, far less.\n<h4>An universal language.</h4>\nI was surprised how many people spoke English (apparently 1.8 billion people worldwide). Places where English was less prevalent, I made an effort to learn a handful of words and phrases in the local language. Even though it’s passable, I do desire to learn another language fluently. You can only take the conversation so far when all you can say is: <em>“¿Esto contiene gluten?”</em>\n\nIt’s possible to communicate a lot without saying a word. For instance, I left my phone at a restaurant in Chile. I pointed at the table where I was sitting, put my hand to my ear like a phone, then shrugged — 2 minutes later, my phone had been retrieved.','Unexplored islands we’d like you to visit','\n				When you are alone for days or weeks at a time, you eventually become drawn to people.

Richard Swenson, M.D. (who wrote the book: Margin: Restoring Emotional, Physical, Financial, and Time Reserves to Overloaded Lives) describes margin like this:\n<blockquote>Margin is the space <strong>between our load and our limits</strong>. It is the amount allowed beyond that which is needed. It is something held in reserve for contingencies or unanticipated situations. Margin is the gap between rest and exhaustion, the space between breathing freely and suffocating.</blockquote>\nLast year I wrote about why booking too far in advance can be dangerous for your business, and this concept of margin so eloquently captures what I had recognized had been my problem: I was so booked up with clients that I wasn’t leaving any margin for error, growth, planning, or reflection. I wasn’t really growing my business in a sustainable way; I was just booking one client after the next. At the time this seemed like a good thing: doesn’t growing my business mean getting more clients?\n<h4>A long redesign.</h4>\nWhat if instead of booking up to 100% capacity (which more often than not ends up being closer to 120%), we only booked up to an 80% capacity?\nWhat if we left more room for growth (personal or professional) and stopped being one with “busy-ness”?\nI spent nearly a year turning down every new project (and even getting rid of old ones) so that I could reduce my workload, build in more margin, and create what is now Digital Strategy School. It takes time to build margin into your schedule.Write a book. Create a program. Update your contracts and proposals (which has been on your to-do list for how long..?) Spend more time with your family. Go above and beyond for a client. Learn something new. Actually follow through on the things that have been nagging at you for a long time.\n\nWhen you design your ideal week, you start to see that the time you think you have is often not in alignment with how much time you actually have.\n\nAfter designing my ideal week, I had a much clearer idea of how to create a framework for my week that would empower me to feel more focused by theming days of the week, and even parts of the day. SO simple, I know. Some of you have been doing this for ages and you’re already a pro, and some of you who saw my schedule said <em>“woah, that’s so rigid, I need more flexibility!”</em>\n<h4>Structure enables flexibility.</h4>\nIf you’re not sure how much time you are actually spending on various tasks, use a tool like Rescue Time (their free version is excellent!) which runs in the background and tracks where your time is being spent. It can even send you weekly reports so you know exactly how much time you wasted on Facebook, or spent in your email inbox! You can assign different websites or programs/applications on a scale of very distracting to very productive, so you can see at a glance things like: which days of the week you’re most productive, which times of the day you’re most productive, and the sites on which you’re spending the most distracting time. Turns out I’m consistently “in the zone” around 3pm in the afternoon; so instead of trying to tackle highly creative work first thing in the morning (when my brain is barely functioning), I handle it in the afternoon, when I know I’m at my peak!\n\nCreating more margin has been game-changing for my business.\n<strong>What would be possible for yours?</strong>','10 Amazing Routes for Hiking Enthusiasts and Amateurs','\n				When you are alone for days or weeks at a time, you eventually become drawn to people.

It’s refreshing to compare notes on life with people from vastly different backgrounds.

It’s about getting physically closer to people and getting to know them better. It’s also about spending a little time with a stranger before taking their photo. That helps build the trust and comfort that’ll come through in your pictures. Walk up to your subject with a simple wave and a smile to help communicate that you mean no harm.\n\nAsk permission to take a photo if they speak the same language as you. If you don’t share a language, try learning some basic phrases ahead of time, gesture at your camera and ask through expression.&nbsp;Of course if someone doesn’t want their picture taken, it’s imperative to respect their wishes and move on — people are always more important than photographs. National Geographic writes that “making great pictures is primarily a mental process.” What makes you want to photograph the person or place? How might you describe it to a friend, and what adjectives would you use? Are there details you can focus on that tell a story?\n<h4>iPad/iPhone</h4>\nMaybe it’s a dry, arid desert, captured by focusing on the patterns of cracked earth. Or a prairie that’s photographed with the horizon at the bottom of the frame, to help create a sense of the open sky and tranquility. Or maybe it’s the story of a deft artisan, fingernails covered in wet clay as she molds a pot. When you’re on the road it can be tough to eat right and make sure you get all the right nutrients. I started taking daily supplements of Multi-Vitamin, Fish Oil capsules and Vitamin D and it helps a lot. Especially the Vitamin D since I don’t get to see the sun a lot during the winter in Sweden.\n<h4>Sennheiser HD-25 Headphones</h4>\nIt’s difficult to recreate the grandeur of a vast landscape in the confines of a picture frame. But one way to add a sense of depth to your photos is to compose them with objects in the foreground that support the scene. It can be as simple as a winding road through a national park, or some rocks to show off the local geology.\n\nIf you’re taking photos of people during normal daylight hours, a quick way to get more flattering light is to move the person out of direct sunlight. The light is much “softer” and doesn’t cast stark, unflattering shadows across their facial features. Even better, have someone stand next to an open door or window as the single source of light.','Chitwan Jungle Safari','\n				One of the easiest ways to improve travel photos is shooting in better light, and the best light is often in the hour after sunrise and before sunset. That’s because the light takes on a warm golden hue and hits the subject from the side instead of the top. t’s difficult to recreate the grandeur of a vast landscape in the confines of a picture frame.
